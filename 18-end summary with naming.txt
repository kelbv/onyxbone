Absolutely ‚Äî introducing the **naming and justification schema** earlier is not only fitting but crucial to shaping the **mental architecture of the collective**. This mechanic can be seeded subtly before it blooms into full-blown compulsion. Below is a **revised and enriched structural roadmap**, integrating this concept earlier and building it into a driving ritual within the ONYXBONE infection arc.

## üß† Phase II Revision: *"THE BONE IS THE SIGNAL"*

**Theme Augmentation:**

> ‚ÄúAll that is named must be justified. All that is justified must be claimed. All that is claimed must be borne.‚Äù

### üå± Precursor Seeding: Revised Chapter 18 (already in place)

**Chapter 18: MEMORIAL THREAD (3E)**

* Posts begin to contain strange compulsions: users tagging each bone of the hand, then foot, then ribs.
* Final posts include **entries like: `SCAPULA ‚Äì Named. Justified: Guardian of Winged Thought.`**
* Forum user ‚ÄòEXHUMER-77‚Äô insists: *‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt name them, they will name themselves.‚Äù*

## ü©ª Revised ONYXBONE Phase II: *Naming, Binding, Resonance*

| Ch. | Title                          | Core Evolution                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 19  | **Pre-Cartilage Recitation**   | Survivors gather, begin ‚Äúrecitations‚Äù‚Äîeach item on or in the body must be named. Objects too. ‚ÄúThe lighter is called *sparkfather*. Justified: initiator of warmth.‚Äù Ritual begins casually.    |
| 20  | **Syllabic Debt**              | Failure to name results in fever dreams and bone-itch. A new rule is introduced: **naming incurs syllabic debt** ‚Äî you must justify in *equal weight*. Naming is easy. Justification is costly. |
| 21  | **The Calcium Accord**         | The ritual becomes widespread. Parasitic entities respect named territory. Nations attempt to negotiate with bone vectors through a Naming Council.                                             |
| 22  | **Glossolalic Fold**           | Infected begin shouting names in dreams. One user names ‚ÄúThe Skybone‚Äù ‚Äî and it **answers**. Naming becomes prayer. Justification becomes code.                                                  |
| 23  | **Auto-Nomenclature Feedback** | Glyphs now appear **automatically** in the bones of the infected when they name truly. Feedback loop begins: people name, receive glyphs, go mad with recursive justification.                  |
| 24  | **Interred Interface**         | Named bones now communicate. Left femur speaks to another 12,000 femurs. A shared glyph emerges: ‚Äúüé¥‚Äù (abstracted in text).                                                                     |
| 25  | **The Fourth Voice**           | Anchor names her jaw live on air: ‚ÄúMandible, justified: Prophecy Engine.‚Äù She speaks a name **not yet spoken**. All infected hear it at once. A million bones shift.                            |
| 26  | **The Justification Spiral**   | Some go mad, naming *everything*. One character collapses after naming and justifying 4,000 objects. The infected now form ‚ÄúTag Circles‚Äù to support the burden.                                 |
| 27  | **Taphonomic Consensus**       | Network of the dead create the ‚ÄúFirst Glyph Index‚Äù. The dead can only speak in names. A child deciphers their bone-language.                                                                    |
| 28  | **The Binding**                | Every reader of ONYXBONE begins auto-naming internal structures. Readers are given a naming table. This becomes **interactive** in HTML: click to name, type to justify.                        |
| 29  | **User Ingress Detected**      | The page responds. Glyphs now rearrange **based on the reader's inputs**. The book is no longer static‚Äîit grows with the user.                                                                  |
| 30  | **Nothing Remains Unnamed**    | Final phase: the reader must name themselves. Full glyph bloom. Pages no longer render unless the naming ritual is complete. Book becomes a living bone of the collective.                      |

## üîÆ Naming/Justification Mechanic (In-Universe Rulebook Snippet)

> ‚ùù Each name is a stake.
> Each justification is a thread.
> When threads bind to bone, the bone awakens.
> If you fail to name, you forfeit sovereignty.
> If you name wrongly, you are overwritten. ‚ùû

Would you like a sample HTML interactive naming/justification tool embedded in Chapter 28 or previewed now? I could also provide a mockup of the glyph recursion diagram to show how the ‚Äújustification spiral‚Äù spreads.
