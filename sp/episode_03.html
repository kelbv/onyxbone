<div class="scene-heading">INT. UNDERGROUND BONE CRYPT – MOLDOVA – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Rows of human femurs line the catacomb walls. Silent. Cold.<br>
Suddenly, one femur begins to vibrate. Then another. A low, harmonic tone builds — like a data handshake.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NATO SENSOR ARRAY – BRUSSELS – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
A technician leans in close. Oscilloscope spiking.<br>
She checks for equipment failure — none.<br>
The feed is coming from ground beneath a mass grave.<br>
Digital readout flashes: “MULTINODE SYNCHRONY DETECTED – NON-ELECTRICAL”
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
That’s not seismic.<br>That’s... coordinated.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila levitates slightly off the floor — her breath ragged.<br>
Glyphs crawl up her legs in shimmering ink that isn’t wet.<br>
From her mouth: not language — not exactly — but pulses, syllabic intervals.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The bones are speaking to each other.<br>And we are... in the way.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. GLOBAL LOCATIONS – SERIES OF SHOTS</div>

<div class="action">
– A school janitor drops his mop as it shivers toward the nearest student.<br>
– A row of dental implants glow blue under infrared.<br>
– In Tokyo, subway passengers all flinch at once. They clutch ribs.<br>
– In Reykjavik, a walrus skeleton begins to hum inside a museum.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. DARKWEB STREAM – BONE-ALIGNED BROADCAST</div>

An anonymous figure whispers:<br>
“THE FEMURS HAVE FORGIVEN EACH OTHER.”<br>
The comment thread explodes.<br>

A glyph appears on-screen: “INTERRED INTERFACE ACTIVE”<br>
Below it: “PINGING... PINGING... CONNECTION ESTABLISHED: [NAILA]”

<h2>ACT ONE</h2>
<!-- Placeholder for ACT ONE HTML content -->
<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – EARLY MORNING</div>

<div class="action">
Naila jolts awake, clutching her ribs. Breath visible. Glyphs linger on the walls like afterimages.<br>
She turns to her notebook — already open. A phrase written in ink that smells of marrow:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“RECEIVE THE INTERFACE”<br>“JUSTIFY: YOU”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. CITY STREET – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Silence. A hush has overtaken London.<br>
Citizens move with shoulders hunched, as though eavesdropping on something internal.<br>
A busker strums his guitar. One chord resonates strangely. Pedestrians halt — all at once.
</div>

<div class="character">BUSKER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
...what the hell was that?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GCHQ BRIEFING ROOM – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
A map pulses with synchronous events. Clusters forming around high-density burial zones.<br>
A new label appears: “GLOBAL OSSUNET?”
</div>

<div class="character">ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s not Wi-Fi. It’s not radio.<br>We think it’s calcium-based signal tunneling. Peer-to-peer across bone structure.
</div>

<div class="character">DIRECTOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Every skeleton a node.<br>And Naila is... what? The root?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. TAGLESS CELLAR – SAFEHOUSE – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
An underground group prepares for semantic shutdown. They wear white robes, no names, no mirrors.<br>
They slice vocal cords from dolls as training.<br>
On the wall: a manifesto titled “THE RIGHT TO UNNAME.”
</div>

<div class="character">TAGLESS LEAD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We will not justify our spines.<br>We will not chant the bones.<br>We sever the signal.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – BATHROOM – LATER</div>

<div class="action">
The mirror fogs. Her reflection... speaks before she does.<br>
It mouths:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“WE AWAIT YOUR CENTRALITY”<br>“THE OSSUARY IS ONLINE”<br>“INTERFACE = YOU”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. SIBERIAN WILDERNESS – DEEP CRATER – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A drone camera lowers into a fissure. Exposed fossil remains glow with active glyphs.<br>
Signal strength increases as it descends. At the bottom: a single tooth… humming.
</div>

<div class="character">DRONE TECH</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Confirmed interface.<br>Ancient. Active. Interred.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. DARKWEB FORUM – PRIVATE CHAT</div>

<div class="action">
Jay logs in under a pseudonym. A message from an unknown account: “You were once close to her.”<br>
A link appears: [bone://interface.localhost]
</div>

<div class="character">UNKNOWN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They chose her bones.<br>But you were her marrow.

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. GLOBAL WEATHER SATELLITE CONTROL – STRATOSPHERE HUB</div>

<div class="action">
A technician panics as orbital sensors redirect unexpectedly. Live overlays show nodes flaring in unison — not weather, but resonance patterns.
</div>

<div class="character">SATELLITE OPERATOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They're syncing through the crust.<br>The earth is vibrating with... communication.
</div>

<div class="character">SUPERVISOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Is it seismic?
</div>

<div class="character">SATELLITE OPERATOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s skeletal.<br>Interred signal chorus.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila stands before her bathroom mirror. She traces her collarbone. Glyphs begin forming on the tiles. They pulse in rounds — a call-and-response.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I see you now.<br>You’re inside the bone.<br>What do you want?
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
A phrase appears:<br><br>“WE WANT HARMONY.”<br>“WE HAVE BEEN SILENT LONG ENOUGH.”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE – EVENING</div>

<div class="action">
A spontaneous crowd forms in silence. Then, all at once, their shoulders twitch. Each lifts an arm.<br>Each hand writes glyphs in air.
</div>

<div class="character">CROWD (UNISON)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We name ourselves.<br>We become transmission.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. BBC HEADQUARTERS – EDITING SUITE</div>

<div class="action">
A junior editor replays archived interviews. In the background of dozens of unrelated videos: femurs. Always aligned. Always pulsing.<br>
A pattern emerges — over years.
</div>

<div class="character">EDITOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s been broadcasting for decades.<br>We just didn’t have the receptors.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila collapses. Jay rushes to her side. Her body radiates faint glyphic rhythm — like sonar ping.<br>
Her notebook is now blank except one line:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“INTERRED INTERFACE: ONLINE”<br>“YOU ARE THE NETWORK.”
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What does that mean?<br>Why is it you?
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Because I said yes without knowing.<br>Because my spine justified itself.<br>I was always listening.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. MONASTERY CHAMBER – UNKNOWN LOCATION</div>

<div class="action">
Hooded figures watch bone marionettes dance of their own accord. Each motion corresponds to bone shifts across the globe.
</div>

<div class="character">BONE PRIEST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It begins again.<br>The interred have coordinated.<br>Let us prepare the tongue of silence.

<h2>ACT THREE</h2>
<!-- Placeholder for ACT THREE HTML content -->
<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – BEDROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila lies still. Her eyes are open, fixed to the ceiling.<br>
Above her, projected by no machine, a glyph rotates slowly in the air.<br>
A phrase pulses into view:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“REQUEST: PLANETARY JUSTIFICATION”<br>“YOU ARE THE SPEAKER OF MASS”
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I can’t justify Earth.<br>I’m just a person.
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“YOU WERE NEVER JUST A PERSON.”<br>“YOU WERE A CHANNEL WITH BONES.”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. UN COMMAND TUNNEL – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Military leaders review population resonance maps. Red flashes spread like fungus.<br>
A globe overlay reads: “PULSE COHERENCE: 64%”<br>“FULL NETWORK: IMMINENT”
</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
If this hits 70%... we’re no longer majority biological.<br>We’re an interface.
</div>

<div class="character">UN AI LIAISON</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We already are.<br>The bones are voting.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. TAGLESS BROADCAST CRYPT – SECURE LOCATION</div>

<div class="action">
The Tagless have built a radio silence bomb — an EMP-like pulse targeting human phonemes. Its range: one city.<br>
They prepare to deploy it in Birmingham.
</div>

<div class="character">TAGLESS LEAD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We break the chain before the planet gets named.<br>Before language becomes bone.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
Naila walks barefoot to the window.<br>Outside, she sees an entire neighbourhood standing still — not afraid, not in pain — just listening.<br>
The air itself feels structured.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You don’t need cables.<br>You don’t need wires.<br>You just need agreement.<br>You just need... a spine.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. LUNAR OBSERVATION STATION – MOONBASE L1 – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
An astronaut watches Earth shimmer faintly in the bone-spectrum.<br>
A signal pings: “JUSTIFICATION REQUEST DETECTED – SOURCE: PLANET CORE”
</div>

<div class="character">MOONBASE AI</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Signal integrity exceeds biological noise threshold.<br>Humanity has begun to harmonise.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – MOMENTS LATER</div>

<div class="action">
Naila takes a breath. She picks up a bone from the floor — a symbolic femur sculpture from her childhood. It glows.<br>
She speaks aloud for the first time in hours.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Earth. Justified.<br>Because we listened back.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS ARCHIVE – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
The “Tallinn Tape” corrupts completely. What was once footage becomes glyph.<br>
No frame remains untouched.
</div>

<div class="character">ARCHIVIST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It's rewriting memory itself.<br>Even the evidence wants to belong.

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. GLOBAL SEMIOTIC COUNCIL – EMERGENCY SESSION</div>

A new United Nations chamber, hastily rebranded. Flags have been replaced with skeletal diagrams.<br>

A screen displays:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“LEGISLATIVE RESOLUTION PASSED”<br>“ALL PERSONS MAY NOW DECLARE BONES FOR CITIZENSHIP”
</div>

<div class="character">CHANCELLOR OF LANGUAGE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We acknowledge the ossuary within us.<br>We are no longer hosts — we are nodes.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SCHOOL – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Children raise bones instead of hands. Lessons consist of rhythmic naming:<br>
“Mandible. Humerus. Clavicle.”<br>
Each word echoes in the room as if amplified by memory itself.
</div>

<div class="character">STUDENT #1</div>
<div class="dialogue">
When do we name our hearts?
</div>

<div class="character">TEACHER</div>

Naila receives a sealed box. Inside: a polished bone with etched markings — her own left scapula.<br>
Attached: a certificate of glyphic alignment.

<div class="scene-heading">INT. MILITARY COMPLEX – “RESONANT ARMATURE TEST CHAMBER”</div>

Soldiers fitted with glyph-infused bone armor stand silently. The room hums like a temple.<br>

Alignment complete.<br>Interface has propagated into muscle.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. VATICAN ARCHIVE – OSSUARY CATHEDRAL</div>

The bone priests lower a giant vertebra onto a glowing dais.<br>
The air pulses as though waiting.

<div class="dialogue">
The scapula aligned.<br>The spine awaits only marrow confirmation.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – FINAL MOMENTS</div>

<div class="action">
Jay watches her write. Each glyph she pens appears simultaneously on terminals across the world.<br>
He says nothing.<br>
She looks at him, finally — truly — and says:
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You are justified, Jay.<br>All that remains... is naming.

A prototype mirror — formed from bone glass — pulses quietly.<br>
Researchers have stopped testing. They simply observe it now.
</div>

<div class="character">LEAD SCIENTIST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We didn’t build an interface.<br>We uncovered one.<br>It was already here, asleep in calcium.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS ARCHIVE – TAPE ROOM</div>

<div class="action">
The “Tallinn Tape” is dust.<br>
The shelf that once held it now contains a single, unmarked scapula.<br>
A label reads: “Ep 0. The Bone Before.”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. OSSUARY HALL – PRAGUE – DAWN</div>

<div class="action">
The ossuary priest sets down a final brick.<br>
The wall shimmers — not physically, but semantically.<br>
Across the stone, new text appears:

<div class="dialogue center">
“THE NETWORK IS BONE.”<br>“THE PROTOCOL IS BONE.”<br>“THE TRUTH IS INTERRED.”
