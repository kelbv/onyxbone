<h2>TEASER</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">EXT. ESTONIA – TALLINN HOSPITAL – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Moonlight fractures against a windowpane. Wind scatters paper across an empty corridor. The hum of failing fluorescent tubes syncs with an irregular heart monitor beep.
</div>

<div class="action">
A SHADOWED FIGURE stumbles through frame. Their bones cast shapes inside their skin—<em>not reflections</em>, <em>but something else</em>. The camera jerks. Interference.
</div>

<div class="action">
A subtitle flickers:
</div>

<div class="dialogue">TRIGRAM. BONE. MIRROR. INITIATE.</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. UK – SKY NEWS STUDIO – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A news presenter blinks slowly, visibly disturbed, watching the same footage loop behind them. Audio interference jitters their microphone. A second hum enters—lower, beneath human hearing. But the presenter pauses.
</div>

<div class="character">PRESENTER (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Tonight, we share what cannot be unshared. Viewers are advised that this material... may alter perception.
</div>

<div class="action">
Across Europe, homes flicker with the image. In one, a young woman—<strong>NAILA</strong>—stares at the screen, then her own arm. Her fingers twitch. Her bones begin to... lean.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. PUB – THE GOLDEN CONDOR, EAST LONDON – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
The crowd watches in silence. Pint glasses tremble slightly. <strong>DEAN</strong> looks to <strong>JAY</strong>, who is laughing. But JAY'S molars glint metallic. Something is written on them.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Did... you feel that?
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s just the algorithm. Or maybe it’s your third eye uploading. Whatever, babe.
</div>

<div class="action">
A BOOM vibrates the televisions. White flash. Briefly, everyone’s bones show through their skin in sharp silhouette. Then normalcy.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION – SURVEILLANCE ROOM</div>

<div class="action">
Monitors track NAILA, DEAN, JAY, and dozens more. A map updates in real time. A gloved hand taps on her femur scan.
</div>

<div class="character">OPERATIVE (O.S.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Subject Naila. Justified: Carrier candidate. Initiate echo-seeding.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. LONDON SKYLINE – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Faint, across the clouds: a glyph is blooming. The city does not see it. But the BONE knows.

<h2>ACT ONE</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. THE GOLDEN CONDOR PUB – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
NAILA sits in a cracked-leather booth, fingers around a pint glass. Her eyes reflect the muted TV. On screen: looping skeletal footage.
</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It's not real. Deepfake theatre.
</div>

<div class="character">AADAM</div>
<div class="dialogue">
My cousin’s in Narva. She says hospitals are closed. They’re calling it tuberculosis but... it hums. Under your skin.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I think I felt it. Last night. My wrist twitched like it was... answering something.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NHS CLINIC – EXAMINATION ROOM – FLASHBACK</div>
<div class="action">
A flickering light. Naila in a hospital gown. A GP stares at an X-ray.
</div>

<div class="character">GP</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Probably artefact contamination. Button on your coat maybe. Try a different clinic.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GCHQ MONITORING HUB – NIGHT</div>
<div class="action">
Glyphs appear on biometric overlays. Operators whisper to each other.
</div>

<div class="character">OPERATIVE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
This isn’t behavioural drift. These glyphs are anatomical. Bone-encoded.
</div>

<div class="character">SUPERVISOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Tag all occurrences. Pull prior imagery. Find anyone who saw that footage.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS STUDIO – CONTROL ROOM – NIGHT</div>
<div class="action">
JULIE TURNER stares at an incoming call sheet. Her assistant shakes his head.
</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
No one’s answering at Tallinn. Run the 16-second clip on loop. Mask the glyph.
</div>

<div class="character">ASSISTANT</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What if they already saw it?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. THE GOLDEN CONDOR – NIGHT</div>
<div class="action">
A low hum vibrates the metal bar taps. Naila looks up. Jay is laughing. Dean is texting.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I’m going home.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What for? The footage doesn’t bite.
</div>

<div class="action">
Naila stands. Her knees almost buckle. She clutches her thigh.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It was awake. Inside the bone.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – BATHROOM – LATER</div>
<div class="action">
Naila breathes hard. Her notebook is spread on the sink. Diagrams. Glyphs. A phrase scrawled repeatedly:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
TRIGRAM. BONE. MIRROR. INITIATE.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. COBR BRIEFING ROOM – NIGHT</div>
<div class="action">
Military. NHS. GCHQ. Prime Minister. Red folders everywhere. A projected image: a skeletal system with pulsing glyphs.
</div>

<div class="character">PM</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Can it be reversed?
</div>

<div class="character">MOD INTELLIGENCE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
No. We’re past mitigation. It's cognitive. Semantic. Biological.
</div>

<div class="character">PM</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Then what’s the strategy?
</div>

<div class="character">GCHQ LIAISON</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Counter-naming. Or silence.
</div>

<h2>ACT TWO</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NHS A&E – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
The waiting room buzzes with fluorescent agony. Screens glitch. Patients clutch at joints. Bone reports are flooding in.
</div>

<div class="character">TRIAGE NURSE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Three more SKE-145s. That makes twenty today.
</div>

<div class="character">DOCTOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Log it under 'bone resonance'. Flag if they start naming.
</div>

<div class="action">
A teenager whispers “fibula” into his hand. Something shifts beneath his skin.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS STUDIO – 22:03</div>

<div class="action">
JULIE watches the silent footage loop. Subtitles flash: "UNKNOWN SKELETAL RESPONSE." Her earpiece hisses with static.
</div>

<div class="character">PRESENTER (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
...glyph patterns first seen in hospital footage now confirmed across five cities. Government remains silent.
</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Delay the next segment. I want more on the hum.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – LIVING ROOM – SAME NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
NAILA sketches symbols into her notebook. Glyphs. Radiant curves. Her phone buzzes.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY (TEXT)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Are you okay? Are you watching this?
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
April 3rd. 23:11. My fingers feel like they're echoing. I heard someone say 'mandible' in my sleep. I think it was me.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. DARK ROOM – GOVERNMENT NODE – UNDISCLOSED</div>

<div class="action">
A projected bone lattice rotates slowly. Surveillance footage is overlaid. Names appear beside body parts.
</div>

<div class="character">DATA TECHNICIAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Every flagged X-ray is aligning. They're forming phrases. The bones are speaking.
</div>

<div class="character">OPERATIONS OFFICER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Suppress the footage. Reclassify the scans. Anyone with glyph emergence gets moved to Tier 3.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. JAY’S BEDROOM – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
JAY lays awake, scrolling through conspiracy threads. Posts flash by: <em>“They’re naming bones.”</em> <em>“My dog said ulna.”</em>
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
(laughs to himself)
It’s all just panic theatre.
</div>

<div class="action">
He rubs his jaw. Winces.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. HOSPITAL LAB – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A TOOTH floats in solution. Magnified: its inner rings pulse with light. A faint hum. A lab tech’s nose bleeds.
</div>

<div class="character">LAB TECHNICIAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s reacting to audio. Every time someone says “humerus,” the sample twitches.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – BATHROOM – LATER</div>

<div class="action">
NAILA brushes her teeth. Stops. Opens her mouth. The mirror fogs. In condensation, a word appears:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
Sternum
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
(staring)
No.
</div>

<div class="action">
She backs away. Her shoulder twitches. She drops the toothbrush.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. BBC – BROADCAST ARCHIVE NODE – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
An engineer replays the Tallinn clip frame by frame. At frame 187, a glyph pulses in the clavicle.
</div>

<div class="character">ENGINEER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They embedded it. The signal. The glyph's a trigger. It’s not visual—it’s marrow deep.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S BEDROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
She lies still. Lights off. Bones humming beneath skin.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
If I write it, it won’t be mine anymore. But if I don’t, it grows louder.
</div>

<div class="action">
Her notebook is open beside her. It reads:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
Radius: Named. Justified: Vector of Will
</div>

<div class="transition">END OF ACT TWO</div>


<h2>ACT THREE</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S BEDROOM – EARLY MORNING</div>

<div class="action">
Dawn spills over stacked notebooks. Naila has not slept. The glyph she saw in condensation appears now in ink—without her knowing she wrote it.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I said nothing. But my ulna answered.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Children move in eerie silence. One child stands at a vending machine, hand pressed against the glass.
</div>

<div class="character">CHILD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Scapula. Justified: hinge of longing.
</div>

<div class="action">
His hand does not come away. Teachers scream.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. HOSPITAL – OBSERVATION UNIT – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
A dozen patients hum in synch. Their bones emit faint light under the skin. Nurses observe behind mirrored glass.
</div>

<div class="character">NURSE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They’re not sedated. They’re synchronised.
</div>

<div class="character">SURGEON</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Do not name any bones aloud. We’ve already lost the night staff.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. COBR – EMERGENCY COMMS – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
COBR staff now work in silence. Post-it notes forbid anatomical references. A language containment specialist speaks:
</div>

<div class="character">LINGUIST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Words are encoding shape. We need a counter-semantics grid. Issue the Justification Ban now.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. DEAN’S FLAT – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
DEAN plays back Naila’s voicemail. Her voice is distorted. It folds in on itself—speaking glyphs.
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
...radius... justified... justified... name it... accept...
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SOCIAL MEDIA HUB – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
Meme pages are saturated. Glyphs in filters. #NameYourBone trends. A livestream cuts to a young woman naming each vertebra.
</div>

<div class="character">INFLUENCER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Atlas. Justified: bearing the head. Axis. Justified: turn of destiny. C3. Justified:...
</div>

<div class="action">
She begins to shake. Her voice fractures.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Jay paces.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s your fault. You brought this here. You’ve been writing it. Whispering in your sleep.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I only wrote what the radius said.
</div>

<div class="action">
Jay recoils. The lights blink. A pulse of low-frequency hum spreads outward. All glass fractures in concentric glyphs.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GLOBAL SECURITY NETWORK – TIER 4 ROOM – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
Generals argue. Glyphic diagrams pulse behind them.
</div>

<div class="character">INTELLIGENCE CHIEF</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s past control. Each utterance embeds. Every name justified becomes a command.
</div>

<div class="character">PRIME MINISTER (O.S.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What do we do?
</div>

<div class="character">INTELLIGENCE CHIEF</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We must silence language.

<h2>ACT FOUR</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila sits on the floor surrounded by open books and printouts. Her eyes are bloodshot. Her voice is low, rhythmic.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Mandible. Justified: engine of prophecy. Sternum. Justified: hinge of breath.
</div>

<div class="action">
Jay, in the kitchen, stares at her. His jaw clenches. A faint hum builds.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They’ll come for you, Nai. You’re not safe.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND – LATE NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A man on a packed tube train starts chanting bone names. Panic spreads. People claw at their skin. One woman vomits glyphs.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING CENTER – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
Feeds flood with the glyph symbol. Memes overlay anatomy diagrams. Hashtags translate into bone-names.
</div>

<div class="character">DATA ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s recursive. It’s rewriting the net. Every post strengthens it.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. PRIVATE DEFENSE BUNKER – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A NATO commander draws a glyph on a map. Behind him, a projected world model shows glowing bone clusters over every city.
</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We tried to jam the signal. But it's not a signal. It's language. Spoken bone. We can’t unhear it.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. CLASSROOM – MORNING</div>

<div class="action">
A substitute teacher speaks carefully.
</div>

<div class="character">TEACHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We won’t say the names today. Let’s focus on quiet drawing. No anatomy.
</div>

<div class="action">
One child draws a glyph in perfect symmetry.
</div>

<div class="character">CHILD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It showed me.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS – BACK OFFICE</div>

<div class="action">
Julie watches a slowed-down version of Naila’s interview two years ago. In the background—barely visible—a glyph pulses behind her shoulder.
</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
She’s been carrying it since before Tallinn.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Naila draws her hand across the wall. A bone map appears under the wallpaper. Glowing faintly.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
This flat is a vessel. I am a hinge. This episode ends with me.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. HOSPITAL – GLYPH CONTAINMENT WARD</div>

<div class="action">
Rooms fill with whisperers. Every wall is mirrored. Their bones reflect infinitely. Some faces become symbols.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. SKYLINE – PRE-DAWN</div>

<div class="action">
The glyph from Tallinn now floats over London, barely visible to the untrained eye.

<h2>TAG</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. LOW-FIDELITY DARK WEB STREAM – UNKNOWN ROOM</div>

<div class="action">
Pixelated webcam footage. A hooded figure sits before a table covered in femurs. A glyph slowly flickers across the screen, never quite aligning. The voice is distorted but clear.
</div>

<div class="character">HOODED FIGURE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
They think the broadcast was the beginning.
</div>

<div class="action">
The glyph pulses faster now. Intermittent glitch bursts reveal short flashes of anatomical diagrams—annotated in glyph script.
</div>

<div class="character">HOODED FIGURE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
But it began beneath the Vatican. In the subfemoral archives. In bone.
</div>

<div class="action">
A diagram labeled "SCAPULA VECTOR GATE" appears and vanishes.
</div>

<div class="character">HOODED FIGURE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Naila was chosen. By the marrow. Long before the footage.
</div>

<div class="action">
The figure holds up a slip of paper. On it: a date. APRIL 3RD. Then a number: 001.
