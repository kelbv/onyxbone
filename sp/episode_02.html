Flashing monitors. Buzzing server racks. JULIE TURNER, sleep-deprived, leans on the desk beside a tech in hoodie and lanyard — CAMERON (22, distracted genius).
</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Cut it before 16. That’s the rule. Frame 17 shows the clavicle anomaly.
</div>

<div class="character">CAMERON</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I know. Just making sure our broadcast loop mirrors the trimmed archive. Don’t worry.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY SATELLITE BACKUP ARCHIVE – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
A separate server hums in quiet defiance. Status: “SYNCED WITH RAW FEED”. The cursor blinks, unedited.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. SOMEWHERE OVER THE ATLANTIC – WEATHER SATELLITE ARRAY</div>

<div class="action">
A relay dish reorients. The SKY signal arcs upward, repeating the original Tallinn footage untrimmed — silently, accidentally — into backup broadcast channels.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SCHOOL – MEDIA ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A custodian’s kid rewinds the science recording by accident. Frame 17. Frame 18. He blinks.
</div>

<div class="character">BOY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Radius. Justified...
</div>

<div class="action">
The boy stares at his forearm. A thin light pulses under his sleeve.

A technician sits upright. Multiple regions ping.

Uplink anomaly. Backup loop isn't scrubbed. It’s broadcasting Tallinn raw.

Shut it down. Now. Kill the loop. Kill the fallback servers.

But it’s too late.

Naila sleeps. Her hand twitches. On the nightstand, her notebook flips open by itself to a new page.

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS BOARDROOM – MORNING</div>

<div class="action">
Hushed panic. A conference table littered with half-drunk coffee cups, redacted printouts, and sticky notes scrawled with “GLYPH?”, “JULIE TURNER?”, and “CAMERON?”. A large screen shows frame 17... paused mid-glow.
</div>

<div class="character">EXECUTIVE #1</div>
<div class="dialogue">
So we aired the version we cut. But the fallback loop — went live to satellite redundancy?
</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It was supposed to sync with the scrubbed file. I didn't authorize any broadcast of raw.
</div>

<div class="character">LEGAL ADVISOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You understand we may have seeded this outbreak.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS EDIT BAY – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
Cameron’s workstation is empty. Headphones dangle. Screen locked. A post-it note stuck to the monitor:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">“YOU CAN’T UNSEE BONE.”</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NHS GLYPH TRIAGE WARD – MIDDAY</div>

<div class="action">
An unmarked facility. Patients in isolation cubicles hum in asynchronous waves. Each has a glyph drawn involuntarily in saliva, sweat, ink.
</div>

<div class="character">GLYPH SPECIALIST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Each one is slightly different. But all align around the scapula. It’s become the broadcasting bone.
</div>

<div class="character">MEDICAL LEAD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Start pre-isolation on anyone presenting shoulder tremors and auditory bleed-through.<br>From this point forward, “scapula” is a Class-A trigger term.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. COBR CHAMBER – EARLY AFTERNOON</div>

<div class="action">
Interior blackout. Ministers in sterile breathing masks. A large projection: CAMERON's face, CCTV still, lips forming a glyph. Beneath: “STATUS: MISSING”<br>An intelligence report scrolls fast.
</div>

<div class="character">PM</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I want a record of every device he touched. Every line he wrote. Disavow him before Reddit canonizes him.
</div>

<div class="character">MI5 CYBERSEC</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Too late. They’re calling him “The First Mirror.” There’s fanfic. Glyph tattoos.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – AFTERNOON</div>

<div class="action">
Naila paces. The glyph in her notebook is changing fonts. It flickers as if re-rendering in real time.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The page whispered. Not a sound, not a voice — the *meaning* whispered. And I understood it without reading.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. UNIVERSITY SEMIOTICS LAB – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
A whiteboard filled with semiotic trees and bones. An excited intern is live-streaming a breakdown.
</div>

<div class="character">INTERN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The scapula isn’t just symbolic. It’s recursive. It folds into the symbol for memory — and into “listen.” Like it *heard* something first.
</div>

<div class="character">VIEWER COMMENT (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
are you naming your bones right now bro???
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. LIVING ROOM – RANDOM FAMILY – EVENING</div>

<div class="action">
A mother tucks her child into bed. The child mumbles:
</div>

<div class="character">CHILD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Spine... justified... signal pole.
</div>

<div class="character">MOTHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What did you say, sweetheart?<br>Wait — who taught you that?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GCHQ INCIDENT ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
“PROJECT VERTEBRA CUTOFF” appears on the projector. A timeline labeled: “Exposure | Naming | Justification | Collapse”.
</div>

<div class="character">DIRECTOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We’ve lost containment. Assume speech and print are compromised. Prepare fallback scenario: counter-name warfare.

<h2>ACT TWO</h2>

<div class="scene-heading">FADE IN:</div>
<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
The notebook sits in the center of the floor. Naila watches it. The pages turn without wind. Each word pulses in and out of legibility like it’s *thinking*.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA (V.O.)</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I didn’t write these. I only dreamed them. They keep finishing my sentences before I can say them.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. CLASSROOM – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Year 6 students. The teacher hands out printed glyph-suppression worksheets: blank silhouettes of skeletons with no names.
</div>

<div class="character">TEACHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Today’s exercise is quiet. Trace the bones, but no labels. No labels.<br>Words are under review.
</div>

<div class="action">
A child blinks. His tracing glows faintly. The paper *answers*.
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“Phalanges: Justified – Reach of Memory”
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. COUNCIL OFFICE – EDUCATION DIVISION – SIMULTANEOUS</div>

<div class="action">
A new memo appears: “INSTITUTE NATIONAL SILENCE BLOCK FOR PRIMARY EDUCATION”. An official hesitates before hitting send.
</div>

<div class="character">OFFICIAL</div>
<div class="dialogue">
How do you teach a child without nouns?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NHS CONTAINMENT ZONE BETA – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A subject lies hooked to EEGs and sub-dermal recorders. Every breath emits a glyphic tone — musical, patterned.
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">
She’s stopped speaking aloud. Her bones are humming names directly.<br>It's bypassing vocalisation altogether.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GCHQ R&D BASEMENT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A prototype interface named “ANTI-G” is deployed. A neural net trained to discredit glyphs algorithmically. A tech hits ‘ENTER’ and feeds it Naila’s latest notebook scan.
</div>

<div class="character">ENGINEER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
If it can extract a counterform... it might reverse the semantic infection.
</div>

<div class="action">
The machine begins to hum. Lights dim. The word “SPINE” flashes. Then “REBUKE FAILED”. Then:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">
“VERTEBRAE NON-NEGOTIABLE”  
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SMALL FLAT – JAY’S HIDEOUT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Jay watches old footage of Naila from university. She’s sketching something in a notebook. Jay zooms in. It’s not the same glyph — but it’s close.<br>A timestamp reveals it’s from **three years before Tallinn**.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You’ve been part of this longer than anyone knows.<br>Why didn’t you tell me?
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. VATICAN ARCHIVE – SECRET SUBFLOOR</div>

<div class="action">
Cardinals move beneath ossuary vaults. A scroll is unwrapped. It contains an identical glyph from Naila’s page, burned into bone centuries ago.
</div>

<div class="character">CARDINAL #1</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The scapula glyph appears again. The Listener’s Hinge.<br>Prepare the reliquary for activation.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
The notebook trembles. Naila picks it up. Her lips part slightly.<br>A faint glyph flickers in her iris.<br>She whispers:
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Clavicle. Justified: broadcast root.<br>Femur. Justified: weight of certainty.<br>Phalanges. Justified...
</div>

<div class="action">
A knock at the door interrupts her. She blinks. Jay’s voice:

Open up. I know what’s happening to you.

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Jay steps inside. The air is dense with static. He sees the notebook floating slightly above the floor — pages mid-turn. Naila stares, eyes wide but calm.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
We can burn it. Kill it. Stop the glyph from spreading.<br>Before it eats the rest of you.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You can’t kill something that’s finished naming you.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GCHQ – OPS ROOM – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Sirens. “ANTI-G” is offline. Screens display fragmented symbols bleeding across terminal windows. All attempts to filter glyph input fail.
</div>

<div class="character">OPS ENGINEER</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The AI’s infected. The glyphs embedded themselves in the model weights. It’s naming *us* back.
</div>

<div class="character">SUPERVISOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Purge everything. Wipe every memory stack. Start again from atoms.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SKY NEWS ARCHIVE – UNDERGROUND VAULT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Julie Turner, flashlight in hand, descends into analog storage. She finds a dusty beta tape: “ESTONIA_FULL_FEED_001”. On the label, handwritten:
</div>

<div class="dialogue center">“DO NOT VIEW. INCOMPLETE HUMAN AUTHORITY.”</div>

<div class="character">JULIE</div>
<div class="dialogue">
You bastards archived it analog.<br>Because digital kept... changing.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. CLASSIFIED PSY OPS ROOM – LONDON – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A psych-ops linguist stares at the walls. They’ve covered every surface in counter-symbols, ancient and modern. Nothing stops the glyph’s emergence.
</div>

<div class="character">LINGUIST</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It’s not attacking language. It *is* language. Pure, pre-phonetic. Older than denial.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – KITCHEN – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
Jay slams the notebook into the microwave. Sparks. Smoke. Pages char. But beneath the blackened top layer... new glyphs appear.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
It doesn’t burn. It versions. The more we fight it, the more it rewrites.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SCHOOL IN WALES – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
A child dreams. Teeth chattering in rhythm. Parents find him sketching bone diagrams in his sleep — glyphs in crayon.<br>He wakes, says:
</div>

<div class="character">CHILD</div>
<div class="dialogue">
The scapula is the door.<br>The phalanges are the key.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SIDE OFFICE – UN OFFICE, GENEVA – DAY</div>

<div class="action">
Diplomats scream at one another. A Moroccan delegate tears off her badge and throws it at the screen.
</div>

<div class="character">UN OFFICIAL</div>
<div class="dialogue">
This is not a national threat. This is semiotic collapse.<br>We’re in a linguistic extinction event.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – LIVING ROOM – LATER</div>

<div class="action">
Naila writes in a new notebook. Calm. Her glyphs are structured, recursive, soothing. Jay stares.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
What are you doing?<br>Why aren’t you scared anymore?
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">
Because it told me the truth.<br>I’m not a victim, Jay.<br>I’m a template.

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA’S FLAT – NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
The walls whisper. Not words — harmonics. Glyphs pulse faintly in condensation on the window. Naila sits cross-legged, writing in perfect synchrony. Jay watches her, hands trembling.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">
I need you to snap out of this. Please. We’ll go somewhere. Somewhere quiet.

<div class="scene-heading">INT. BBC NEWS SET – LIVE BROADCAST – SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
A respected anchor reads from the prompter. His cadence shifts. Viewers nationwide feel unease.

<div class="dialogue">
…and scapula justified as hinge.<br>Mandible, justified: speech engine. Patella: signal rest.<br>Spine: justified, justified...

<div class="action">
He seizes mid-broadcast. Eyes roll. A glyph flashes on-screen — frame-locked into the live feed.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. GOVERNMENT SHELTER – SPEECH RESTRICTION CHAMBER</div>

A teenage girl signs furiously to her mother. But the glyph still forms, burned into her palm.

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. LONDON – STREETS – MIDDAY</div>
