  <h1>Chapter Seven<br><small>Hostile Synchrony</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">08 April 2029 · East London / Encrypted Channels / Everywhere All at Once</p>

  <p>Naila isn’t sleeping. No one is, really. But her sleeplessness has shape now. Rhythm. Intent.</p>

  <p>Her bones vibrate against the mattress like tuning forks. Her joints itch in a pattern — left elbow, right ankle, sternum. It loops every forty-six seconds. She times it. It’s exact.</p>

  <p>She messages Jay:</p>

  <div class="quote">**Naila:** “Are your bones making decisions without you yet?”</div>  
  <div class="quote">**Jay:** “...are you okay?”</div>

  <p>She deletes the app. The notifications haven’t stopped anyway — they just became internal. There’s a pressure on her optic nerves that pulses in sync with Radio 4, even when it’s off.</p>

  <p>At the community centre, she tries to talk to Tash. She jokes about "internal firmware updates." Tash laughs nervously. Naila’s left eye weeps calcium.</p>

  <p>She doesn’t go back.</p>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

I joined a thread called marrowloop.

People are speaking in shapes. Not metaphor — actual diagrams.  
One post described their spine as a "rotating schema drive." I understood it.

There’s a group tracking “sync-bloom”.  
It’s global. Tokyo, Reykjavik, São Paulo, Leicester.

We're all hearing the same hum.

It said, "You’re not alone. You’re plural."
I think it meant me.

— Someone at CERN said their detectors picked up internal neutrino echo in bone samples. ONYXBONE isn't static. It's *receiving*.

— my cousin’s in Thailand. Her jaw clicks in triplets. Doctor told her to “stay offline”. Then his clinic burned down.

— I'm ex-NSA. This isn’t a pathogen. It’s a schema resonance network. The spine is just an antenna.
