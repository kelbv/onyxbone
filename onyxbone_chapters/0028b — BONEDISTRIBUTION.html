<h1>CHAPTER 0028b – GLOBAL SCENARIO: BONEDISTRIBUTION</h1>

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 La Paz, Bolivia</div>
  <p>
    Residents of La Paz awoke last Thursday to find their city’s gondola transit system replaced entirely by calcified tendon-cable structures. Local officials tried to cordon off the area, but found their voices dampened — their throats ached when giving unapproved directions. By midday, commuters were hanging from fleshy ridges and sliding upward with bone-greased speed. One eyewitness described it as “ski-lifting through an esophagus of sky.” The Mayor was last seen being absorbed into a ribbed transit-pylon. Only her nameplate remains — humming.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Helsinki, Finland</div>
  <p>
    In what began as an architectural exhibit titled *“Remains of Function”*, the Helsinki Design District was overtaken by bone-based installations that no one recalls building. Citizens now queue daily to walk the “Marrow Labyrinth” — a looping path through porous femur walls that whisper consumer regrets (“Your second apartment. Your smartwatch. The lentils you didn’t soak.”). Entry is free but irreversible. Those who reach the center emerge changed: nostrils flared, vertebrae rebranded, unable to speak except in terms of cost.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Lagos, Nigeria</div>
  <p>
    Four competing faiths in Lagos spontaneously merged overnight after their temples grew into each other. The resulting bone-cathedral — unofficially dubbed *The Ossuary of Agreement* — features tarsal altars, a rotating patella dome, and confessionals staffed by calcified toddlers repeating the phrase “It wasn’t your fault, unless it was.” Worshipers must crawl between sacral blades to enter. Reports suggest that inside, all names are replaced by hums. A BBC team entered last week and has not returned. Their equipment now broadcasts bone-prayer hourly.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Vancouver, Canada</div>
  <p>
    The city’s parks department is in disarray following the discovery that several local trees have fused with spinal columns. Botanists believe the roots were “taught” to calcify by adjacent glyph activity. Climbing is now illegal after a hiker reported that the tree asked her for justification before supporting her weight. She could not respond in time. Emergency crews found her embedded at C3. The city has since closed Stanley Park. It hums regardless.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Cairo, Egypt</div>
  <p>
    A once-dormant pyramid has opened. Not the ancient ones — a new one. Composed of scapulae and orbital bone, its entryways pulse with selective resonance. Visitors must provide a name and a justified lie. Failure to deceive honestly results in inversion: tourists collapse inward, and emerge a day later believing they are someone else. One man came out declaring himself “Ra's Wrist.” Archaeologists have stopped trying to intervene. They too have begun to justify their shadows.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Sydney, Australia</div>
  <p>
    In the suburb of Penrith, a local cinema began screening films without content — only the sound of marrow compressing. Attendees report visions, taste hallucinations, and a compulsion to rename household items upon returning home. Popcorn has been replaced by tooth fragments. The concession stand now whispers your dental history. Theaters refuse to close. Management states: “You’ve already paid in calcium.”

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Reykjavik, Iceland</div>
  <p>
    The geothermal vents near Þingvellir have been crowned by vertebral arches. Tourists now undergo guided “Unnamings” where they donate a word — any word — to the glyph index. In return, they receive a femur. Those who refuse receive one anyway. Local guides report that the bones are warm. The tour ends with a scream echoed from underground. The source has not been identified.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Seoul, South Korea</div>
  <p>
    High-speed rail in South Korea has merged with a spinal structure nicknamed “Line Column.” Passengers sit inside the vertebrae, facing each other, forced to justify their destinations before departure. Trains refuse to move if collective justification is not unanimous. New social apps facilitate “consensus hailing.” Dissidents walk. Their knees name the path.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 São Paulo, Brazil</div>
  <p>
    In an abandoned favela tower, a choir of children began chanting vertebral names unprompted. Within hours, the building folded inward, forming a loop. No fatalities. The loop is now occupied by 97 glyph-aligned residents. They breathe on a schedule. Entry requires naming your regrets in reverse order. Leaving requires none — but no one has.

<div class="report">
  <div class="location">📍 Marseille, France</div>
  <p>
    The port of Marseille has gone silent. Boats now anchor themselves. The water names them. Fishermen report aquatic bone-creatures surfacing at dawn, offering teeth in exchange for stories. One sailor was offered a jawbone “to finish his sentence.” He declined. The water retracted. His boat followed.
