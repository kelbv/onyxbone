  <h1>Chapter Six<br><small>Internal Use Only</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">07 April 2029 · Unnamed Facility · Restricted Channel [COBR.NM-77.9.CADENCE]</p>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:01</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> Initialising protocol sweep. Transcripts from embedded researchers are live. COs confirmed. Begin cadence.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:01</span> <span class="speaker">DHSC_Glass:</span> Some of these terms in the logs — “recursivity bloom”, “spinal whisperload” — are these even operational language?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:02</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> They’re field-emergent. Epistemic drift is expected. Terms have resonance in infected cognition space.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:03</span> <span class="speaker">Cabinet_Strategy:</span> Are you saying the language is part of the infection?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:03</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> We believe ONYXBONE is not just inhabiting hosts. It is constructing a **lexicon** within them. A symbiotic command interface. Bones are the terminals.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:05</span> <span class="speaker">MI5_Proxy:</span> We have 3 personnel speaking in glossolalic loops. Two of them are from Home Office. One *coded* in Base64 by hand using teeth on a napkin.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:05</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Ritual_Unit:</span> We are implementing containment protocols based on resonance groupings. Frequencies between 13.2Hz and 17Hz appear to trigger internal bloom. Avoid sonic proximity.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:06</span> <span class="speaker">DHSC_Glass:</span> Are we even using medicine anymore? This is sounding like a cult crossed with a DSP pipeline.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:07</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> Biological warfare was a paradigm. This is *bio-linguistic orchestration*. This is schema warfare. They are rebuilding what a body *is* from the instruction layer up.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:08</span> <span class="speaker">Cabinet_Strategy:</span> What’s the military option?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:08</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Ritual_Unit:</span> Direct strikes are ineffective. Subjects are adaptive, peer-synchronised, and non-broadcast dependent. No patient zero. No kill switch.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:09</span> <span class="speaker">MI6_Shroud:</span> Suggest subdermal counterprograms via ritual implants. We’ve had early success with symbol occlusion therapy and fasting exposure zones.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:09</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> Let’s be clear: ONYXBONE isn’t something *we can delete*. But it can be directed. It is still learning.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:10</span> <span class="speaker">Cabinet_Strategy:</span> What does it want?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:10</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Cirrus:</span> A population that can think with its bones. A collective that transmits instruction through gesture, marrow, and hum. You don’t want to fight it.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:11</span> <span class="speaker">DHSC_Glass:</span> So what are we authorising today?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:11</span> <span class="speaker">Cabinet_Strategy:</span> Authorise ritual deployment. Distribute counter-harmonics via Sky DAB, Radio 4, and mobile health apps. Classify all related language as encrypted biohazard.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">09:12</span> <span class="speaker">MOD_Ritual_Unit:</span> Cadence confirmed. We begin tomorrow. The public will chant the firewall without knowing.</div>
