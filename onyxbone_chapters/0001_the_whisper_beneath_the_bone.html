                <p>The air in the COBR briefing room was heavy, saturated with the unspoken tension of a world teetering on the edge of revelation. Prime Minister Eleanor Havers sat at the head of the table, her fingers drumming a slow, deliberate rhythm against the polished oak. Around her, the faces of her closest advisors reflected a spectrum of emotions—fear, anger, and something darker: ambition.</p>
                
                <p>“We’re compromised,” said Jonny Nash, the Prime Minister’s special advisor, breaking the silence. His voice was sharp, cutting through the room like a scalpel. “The Estonian footage is out. Sky News is running it tonight. We’ve got less than an hour before the world sees what we’ve been trying to contain.”</p>
                
                <p>Havers leaned back in her chair, her gaze fixed on the holographic display hovering above the table. The footage looped silently: a dimly lit room, a restrained man, and the grotesque revelation of the glyph coil embedded deep within his femur. The coil pulsed faintly, its etched spirals glowing with an unnatural light.</p>
                
                <p>“What are we looking at?” she asked, her voice steady but laced with unease.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Fara Bashiri, the Chief Scientific Adviser, adjusted her glasses and cleared her throat. “It’s not biological, at least not entirely. The structure is too precise, too deliberate. We’re seeing evidence of recursive architecture—something designed to evolve, to adapt. This isn’t just a parasite. It’s a system.”</p>
                
                <p>The room fell silent again, the weight of her words sinking in. Finally, the Defence Secretary spoke, his tone grim. “If this is a system, then who—or what—is controlling it?”</p>

                <h2>Unveiling the Protocol</h2>
                <p>As the discussion deepened, a classified document was projected onto the central screen: the VECTOR SKELETION protocol. Its cryptic language and jargon-filled directives painted a chilling picture of a world unprepared for the implications of the ONYXBONE vectors.</p>

                <p>“We need to control the narrative,” said Harriet Yule, Director of Government Communications. “If this gets out unfiltered, we’re looking at mass panic, a collapse of public trust, and potentially, geopolitical chaos.”</p>
                
                <p>“And if we suppress it?” asked the Foreign Secretary. “What happens when the vectors activate? When the glyphs start... doing whatever they’re designed to do?”</p>
                
                <p>“Then we’re already too late,” Bashiri replied. “The vectors are embedded in millions, maybe billions, of hosts. This isn’t an invasion. It’s an assembly.”</p>

                <h2>The First Whisper</h2>
                <p>Meanwhile, across London, the first whispers of the truth were beginning to spread. On social media, fragmented clips of the Estonian footage surfaced, accompanied by frantic speculation and conspiracy theories. Hashtags like <strong>#BoneCode</strong> and <strong>#GlyphInsideUs</strong> trended globally, as users dissected every frame, searching for answers.</p>
                
                <p>In a dimly lit pub in East London, a group of strangers huddled around a phone, watching the footage in stunned silence. “It’s not just a disease,” one of them whispered. “It’s a message.”</p>
                
                <p>But the message was incomplete, its meaning obscured by layers of fear and misinformation. And as the clock ticked closer to Sky News’s broadcast, the question loomed larger than ever: what was the endgame?</p>
