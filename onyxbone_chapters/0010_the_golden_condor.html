  <h1>Chapter Ten<br><small>The Golden Condor</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">11 April 2029 · The Golden Condor · Bethnal Green</p>

  <p>Naila walks back into the pub as if it never closed.  
The lights hum. The same game is on. But she remembers this score from twelve days ago. She remembers watching it with Jay. But Jay is gone. And the man at the bar has Jay’s mouth but not his eyes.</p>

  <p>Dean is in the booth. He smiles, but his lips move too precisely. When he speaks, every third sentence is from Naila’s journal.</p>

  <div class="quote">“We contain things we didn’t request.”  
“We are not required to remember.”  
“Sit. The loop will begin soon.”</div>

  <p>The television above the bar glitches. It shows a newsreader with no mouth. Subtitles crawl across the screen: *ACCEPTANCE BROADCAST PHASE 3E BEGINS IN: 00:03:12*</p>

  <p>Naila orders a Guinness. The head is already flat. The barman hands her a glass, blinks four times, and says:  
<em>“You’ve brought the spine back online.”</em></p>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

TRANSCRIPT: SUBJECT ‘DEAN’ – GOLDEN CONDOR  
BEGIN 20:03:12

“You came here knowing. That’s the qualification.”  
“The loop chooses its repeaters. You’re not broken — just echoed.”  
“This is where your signal stabilises. This is where your thoughts are triangulated.”  
“Accept the third. You are 3E now. That’s not a warning. That’s a permission.”
