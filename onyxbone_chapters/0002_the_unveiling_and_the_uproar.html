                <p>The Sky News broadcast hit the airwaves like a shockwave. Anchors, their faces grim, presented the Estonian footage with a mixture of journalistic duty and barely concealed horror. The segment, titled "The Bone Within," dissected the grainy video, interspersing it with expert commentary—some speculative, some alarmingly close to the truth Dr. Bashiri had outlined in the COBR.</p>
                <p>In homes, pubs, and offices across the nation, and soon the world, conversations ceased. Eyes were glued to screens. The image of the pulsing glyph coil, now broadcast in high definition, became an instant, terrifying icon. The term "ONYXBONE" and "Vector" were no longer confined to classified documents; they were on everyone's lips, typed into every search engine.</p>

                <h2>The COBR Reacts</h2>
                <p>Back in the COBR, the atmosphere was electric. Prime Minister Havers watched the broadcast on a wall-mounted screen, her expression unreadable. Jonny Nash was on a secure line, his voice a low, urgent growl as he coordinated damage control.</p>
                <p>“The official line is this: an isolated, anomalous medical phenomenon under urgent investigation,” Harriet Yule, Director of Government Communications, announced, reading from a hastily prepared statement. “We emphasize ‘isolated.’ We downplay ‘threat.’ We offer reassurance and promise transparency once facts are verified.”</p>
                <p>“Facts?” scoffed the Defence Secretary. “The ‘fact’ is, we have an unknown entity embedded in our population, and we don’t know what it does or why it’s there. How long until ‘isolated’ becomes ‘everywhere’ in the public mind?”</p>
                <p>Dr. Bashiri interjected, her voice cutting through the rising panic. “The VECTOR SKELETION protocol outlines several contingency stages. We are now, unequivocally, in a Stage I Dissonant Messaging Injection scenario. The protocol’s primary aim was to manage this exact situation—a premature public reveal.”</p>
                <p>“Manage it, Doctor, or simply delay the inevitable?” Havers asked, turning from the screen. Her eyes, usually so full of steely resolve, held a flicker of something akin to dread.</p>

                <h2>The Digital Deluge and the Human Cost</h2>
                <p>Online, the reaction was a maelstrom. Social media platforms exploded. #BoneCode, #GlyphInsideUs, and now #OnyxbonePanic trended worldwide. Misinformation spread as rapidly as fear. Doctored images, wild theories of alien invasion, government conspiracy, and divine retribution flooded forums and comment sections.</p>
                <p>Emergency lines were overwhelmed. Hospitals reported a surge in patients demanding X-rays, convinced they too carried the ‘bone code.’ The psychological toll was immediate and immense. The abstract fear of a distant threat had become a visceral, personal terror.</p>
                <p>In a quiet suburban home, a teenager named Maya stared at her own leg, then at the news report, a sickening dread coiling in her stomach. She remembered a strange, persistent ache in her femur months ago, dismissed by doctors as growing pains. Now, a horrifying new possibility took root in her mind.</p>

                <h2>Whispers of Control</h2>
                <p>Amidst the chaos, other, more shadowy players watched with keen interest. In hidden data centers, algorithms parsed the global reaction, analyzing sentiment, tracking the spread of information, and identifying key nodes of influence. For some, the ONYXBONE revelation was not a crisis, but an opportunity.</p>
                <p>The final directive of the VECTOR SKELETION protocol echoed in the minds of those few who knew its full extent: <em>“If operational breach exceeds 30%, full trigger of BLACK SALT (societal wipe of vector memory using satellite-borne mnemonic resonance jammers) is to be considered preferable to assimilation.”</em></p>
                <p>The question now was, how close were they to that 30% threshold? And who would make the call?</p>
