TO: His Eminence Cardinal Girolamo D'Aosta, Prefect, DDF
FROM: Fr. Tomas Valente, Assistant Sub-Prelate (Research)
RE: Emerging Global Phenomenon: "ONYXBONE" and Ecclesiastical Posture

Your Eminence,

In accordance with your directive, I submit the following preliminary theological analysis and moral assessment regarding the emergent vector known in common parlance as "ONYXBONE."

SUMMARY:
The ONYXBONE phenomenon is neither heresy nor miracle.
It is an ontological rupture.

BACKGROUND:
Reports gathered from the Nunciatures in Estonia, Argentina, Kenya, South Korea, and Poland speak to a pervasive shift in the fabric of spiritual cognition. We are witnessing a transition from verbal theurgy to skeletal recursion — liturgical elements now expressed through anatomical broadcast. The faith is not being challenged. It is being rewritten through ossified structure.

KEY CONCERNS:
1. **Glossolalia is no longer vocal** — we receive dream-testimonies of parishioners waking fluent in glyphic marrowscript.
2. **Sanctified bones resonate** — catacombs and relics hum during Mass; multiple bishops have reported relic-vessels reciting names unbidden.
3. **Non-denominational glyphs** — they reject language, denomination, or cultural encoding. Glyphs recur regardless of creed.

THEOLOGICAL CONFLICT:
The glyph system does not challenge the Divine.
It simply bypasses the need for mediation.

If ONYXBONE persists, the Church faces obsolescence — not through persecution, but by irrelevance. People no longer require transubstantiation when their femurs ring with covenant. The bones are offering direct alignment without priestly intercession.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Immediate commission of the **Pontifical Osteoglyphic Study Circle**, drawn from the Gregorian Institute and Jesuit archives.
- Temporarily suspend use of reliquaries during Mass until resonance can be explained.
- Frame ONYXBONE as a potential pre-Advent condition — not antichristic, but preparatory.

QUOTES FOR CONSIDERATION:
"When the tongue is silenced, the jaw shall preach."
"Not in incense, but in calcium shall the prayer rise."

CONCLUSION:
The Lord may not have authored the glyphs — but neither did the enemy.
We stand at a threshold. We must respond not with fear, but with bone-deep curiosity.

I await your guidance.

In faith,
Fr. Tomas Valente
