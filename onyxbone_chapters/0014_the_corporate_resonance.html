  <h1>0014: THE CORPORATE RESONANCE</h1>

  <p class="timestamp">08:32 BST — AURELION GROUP, LONDON HQ, 47th Floor</p>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:33</span> <span class="speaker">CHAIR (Dr. S. Vey):</span> This session is classified. All devices in the vault, now. We begin with the mass x-ray anomaly. Ms. Kwan, summary?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:34</span> <span class="speaker">Kwan (Chief Data Officer):</span> NHS flagged 14,000+ UK citizens with non-biological internal structuring. 91% show no external symptoms. All records rerouted to our internal node. No leaks—yet. But the Estonian extraction footage is circulating on darknet. The glyph coil is real. It matches our LAMI stack signatures.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:35</span> <span class="speaker">Roth (Legal):</span> If this surfaces, we’re exposed to criminal liability. The ONYXBONE vector is now a matter of public health, not just IP containment. We’re talking about distributed, weaponizable payloads coded to host DNA. This is beyond plausible deniability.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:36</span> <span class="speaker">Dr. S. Vey:</span> The origin? Any progress? I want specifics, not theories.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:36</span> <span class="speaker">Kwan:</span> Three plausible vectors: Tallinn broadcast shadow, recursive language compression in neural sims, or deliberate sabotage. All point to legacy code in our LAMI bioware stack. Forensic audit ongoing. But the glyphs—those are not emergent. They’re engineered. We have evidence of external manipulation, possibly state-level or rogue AI intervention.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:37</span> <span class="speaker">Mendez (PR):</span> Media narrative is holding, but the phrase “marrow misalignment” is trending. We can’t suppress the geometric dream reports much longer. Sky News is prepping a segment. If the glyph coil footage airs, we lose narrative control. We need a counter-narrative—now.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:38</span> <span class="speaker">Roth:</span> We need a legal firewall. If the ONYXBONE protocol is traced to AURELION, we’re looking at sovereign asset seizure, not just fines. We need to discredit the footage, the journalists, and anyone linking us to Tallinn. I want a full disinfo package ready by noon.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:39</span> <span class="speaker">Dr. S. Vey:</span> Technical response. Dr. Iqbal?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:39</span> <span class="speaker">Iqbal (Chief Science Officer):</span> The vectors are evolving. Bone filaments now exhibit phase-laced magnetism. Marrow resonance peaks in ex-military personnel. Our neural lace is acting as a signal amplifier. We’re seeing echo speech in isolated staff—semantic drift, not psychosis. The glyphs are synchronizing. If the quorum threshold is reached, we could see a cascade event—distributed activation across all hosts. This is not just infection. It’s assembly. We’re building something, and we don’t know what the end state is.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:40</span> <span class="speaker">Mendez:</span> We have whistleblowers. One coded a message in Base64 using their teeth. It’s viral—literally and memetically. If this leaks, we’re not just facing regulatory fines. We’re facing existential liability. Parliament is already circling for blood.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:41</span> <span class="speaker">Roth:</span> If this is weaponizable, we need to decide: containment or monetization? If we can’t control the vector, we sell the countermeasure. If we can’t sell, we burn the evidence. No half-measures.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:41</span> <span class="speaker">Iqbal:</span> Standard immuno-viral logic is useless. Only semantic burn—over-saturation—shows promise. But it risks mass REM bleed and bone chatter. Glyph-field jamming at 13–17 Hz is possible, but causes equipment failures and staff blackouts. If the glyphs are a distributed system, jamming could trigger a failsafe—forced activation or data wipe. We’re playing with a loaded gun, blindfolded.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:42</span> <span class="speaker">Kwan:</span> We’re seeing identical sigils drawn in chalk, paint, blood. Internal comms are compromised. Recommend full protocol lockdown. If the glyphs propagate through language, we may already be past containment. We need to consider mnemonic quarantine—memory isolation for all exposed staff.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:43</span> <span class="speaker">Dr. S. Vey:</span> What’s the worst-case scenario? I want it on record.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:43</span> <span class="speaker">Iqbal:</span> Societal wipe of vector memory using satellite-borne mnemonic resonance jammers. “Black Salt” protocol. But if we trigger it, we lose everything—data, assets, even our own operational continuity. If the glyphs are a distributed payload, we could be looking at a latent infrastructure—weaponized, dormant, waiting for a signal. If that signal comes, we’re not just liable. We’re obsolete.

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:44</span> <span class="speaker">Mendez:</span> Government pressure is mounting. Parliament wants a scapegoat. We’re it. If we don’t act, we’re the next headline. If we do, we risk escalation. The glyphs are already in the wild. We need a third option—controlled disclosure, or a sacrificial asset.

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:45</span> <span class="speaker">Roth:</span> Then we escalate. If we can’t contain ONYXBONE, we control the narrative. Or we burn it all down. I want a list of expendable subsidiaries and offshore proxies. If we need to cut ties, we do it before the market opens.

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:46</span> <span class="speaker">Dr. S. Vey:</span> Prepare the Omega Directive. No further discussion. This meeting never happened. If anyone leaks, they’re not just fired—they’re erased. Understood?

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:47</span> <span class="speaker">Kwan:</span> There’s another layer. Our partners at Sable Analytics—nominally private, but with deep ties to the Home Office—have been running continuous pattern recognition on all flagged individuals. They’re leveraging NHS biometric feeds, telecom metadata, and even smart home telemetry. The ONYXBONE vector is now cross-referenced with behavioral drift, purchase history, and social graph anomalies. It’s not just containment. It’s preemptive targeting.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:48</span> <span class="speaker">Roth:</span> Are we exposed through Sable?</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:48</span> <span class="speaker">Kwan:</span> Sable’s structure is deniable. They operate as a consultancy, but their data flows directly into the National Fusion Cell. If this goes public, it’s not just a corporate scandal—it’s a state-corporate hybrid operation. We’re already seeing chatter about “bonewatch” on encrypted forums.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:49</span> <span class="speaker">Dr. S. Vey:</span> Keep Sable at arm’s length. If the vector leaks through their net, we need plausible deniability. Prepare a statement framing Sable as an overzealous contractor, nothing more.</div>

  <div class="log-entry"><span class="timestamp">08:49</span> <span class="speaker">Mendez:</span> Understood. I’ll coordinate with Sable’s PR. We’ll seed the narrative that their surveillance was a proactive public health measure, not a covert operation.</div>
