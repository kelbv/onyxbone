                <h2>Section 1: The Breaking Point</h2>
                <p>Naila's hands trembled as she wrote in her <a href="linked_artifacts/naila_journal_entry_may19.txt">journal</a>. The geometric patterns beneath her skin pulsed with an otherworldly green light, matching the rhythm of her racing heart. Around her, the darkness of East London felt alive, watching, waiting.</p>

                <h2>Section 2: Echo Chamber</h2>
                <p>The <a href="linked_artifacts/east_london_community_chat.txt">community chat</a> had gone silent hours ago, but something worse had replaced it - the sound of thousands of minds thinking in unison, a psychic chorus that made her teeth ache and her skull throb.</p>
                <p>Through the window, she watched as green lights flickered in windows across the estate, each one marking another person caught in what the <a href="linked_artifacts/vector_skeletion_protocol.txt">protocol</a> called "vector resonance."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 3: The Silent Prophecy</h2>
                <p>The woman they called the <a href="linked_artifacts/daily_chronicle_kings_cross_prophetess.txt">Kings Cross Prophetess</a> had warned them all. Now her words echoed through the hive mind: "When the sceptre rises, the bones will remember."</p>
                <p>Naila felt it in her marrow - ancestral memories bubbling up like dark water from a forgotten well. She wasn't just herself anymore; she was every bearer of these vectors throughout history, every host who had ever carried this terrible gift.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 4: Systems Collapse</h2>
                <p>The <a href="linked_artifacts/nhs_internal_memo.txt">NHS memo</a> had been their last warning, but it came too late. Even as the government enacted Protocol Omega, trying to contain what was happening, the change was spreading through the population like wildfire.</p>
                <p>Through their shared consciousness, Naila could feel others reading Elena Torres's <a href="linked_artifacts/elena_torres_the_silent_cities.txt">research</a> on mass vector activation. The cities wouldn't be silent much longer.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 5: The Seeking</h2>
                <p>The <a href="linked_artifacts/home_office_briefing_nexus_seekers.txt">Nexus Seekers</a> were moving through the streets now, their vehicles marked with subtle geometries that matched the patterns under her skin. But they weren't here to help - they were here to contain, to suppress what the <a href="linked_artifacts/home_office_briefing_network_reckoning.txt">Network Reckoning</a> had set in motion.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 6: Emerald Dawn</h2>
                <p>The first rays of dawn brought no comfort. The sky had taken on a sickly green tinge, and Naila knew - they all knew - that EMERALD SCEPTRE wasn't just a protocol trigger. It was a awakening, encoded in their bones since before recorded history.</p>
                <p>Through the hive mind, she felt the last pieces click into place. The vector skeletion hadn't infected them - it had been waiting within humanity all along, dormant in our DNA, waiting for this precise moment to activate.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 7: The Reckoning</h2>
                <p>As the emerald light grew stronger, Naila made her final journal entry. The vectors weren't a weapon to be contained, as the authorities had thought. They were an inheritance, a transformation written into humanity's blueprint eons ago.</p>
                <p>And now, as thousands of minds joined together in terrified understanding, she realized the truth - EMERALD SCEPTRE wasn't the end. It was just the beginning.</p>
