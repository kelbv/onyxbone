                <h2>Section 1: Digital Darkness</h2>
                <p>The screens in Dr. Chen's surgery went dark one by one. Across East London, devices connected to the NHS network began systematically shutting down. Protocol Omega wasn't just a contingency - it was a blackout.</p>
                <p>But before the last screen died, Naila caught a glimpse of something that made her blood run cold: the <a href="linked_artifacts/vector_skeletion_protocol.txt">Vector Skeletion Protocol</a>, its text rapidly being redacted in real-time.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 2: Calcium Bloom Rising</h2>
                <p>The phrase jumped out at her from the disappearing document - "Calcium Bloom Rising." The term for what she was experiencing, what they were all experiencing. The hum in her bones wasn't just a symptom; it was a sign of "vector resonance."</p>
                <p>Through the shared consciousness network, she felt others recognizing the same terms, pieces of a puzzle falling into place across countless minds simultaneously.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 3: The Memory Bleed</h2>
                <p>Mrs. Kumar was the first to speak what they were all feeling. "The memories," she said, her voice trembling. "They're not just random thoughts. They're from... before. Before us."</p>
                <p>The protocol had warned of this - "temporal bleedthrough in near-host dream states." But these weren't dreams. They were awakening memories, shared across the hive-reticulated swarm intelligence that the protocol had identified.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 4: Emergence</h2>
                <p>As the digital blackout spread, something else was spreading too - a new kind of awareness. The calcium-matrix level integration mentioned in the protocol wasn't just biological; it was creating a network of consciousness that transcended the need for technology.</p>
                <p>In the darkness of the surgery, Naila watched as patterns of light began to play across people's skin, geometric forms that matched the drawings in her journal, now understood as manifestations of the vector activation phase.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 5: The Counter-Protocol</h2>
                <p>Dr. Chen was frantically writing everything down on paper. "They're trying to suppress the protocol, suppress our understanding," she said. "But they don't realize - we don't need the documents anymore. We're living it."</p>
                <p>Through their shared connection, knowledge of the protocol was being preserved, not in computers or on paper, but in the collective consciousness of the affected.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 6: Ancestral Echoes</h2>
                <p>The memories were becoming clearer now. Not just recent ones, but ancient ones. Glimpses of civilizations lost to time, of decisions made in the deep past that were only now coming to fruition. The "alien memories" mentioned in the protocol weren't alien at all - they were human, just from a time beyond history's reach.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 7: Hive Mind Rising</h2>
                <p>Outside, the streets of East London were filling with people drawn together by the invisible network. The authorities had tried to prevent this by redacting the Vector Skeletion Protocol, but they hadn't understood what they were dealing with. This wasn't just information - it was evolution, just as Dr. Chen had said.</p>
                <p>"They think this is a containment breach," Naila said, understanding flowing through the network. "But you can't contain something that's already everywhere. In our bones. In our blood. In our collective memory."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 8: The Signal Strengthens</h2>
                <p>As night fell over London, the message they'd detected earlier was becoming clearer. It wasn't coming from the devices anymore - they were all dead now. It was coming from within, from the very calcium matrix of their bones, carrying with it the weight of ancestral memory and the promise of something unprecedented.</p>
                <p>Through the darkness, Naila could feel it building: EMERALD SCEPTRE was about to trigger, and not even Protocol Omega could stop what was coming.</p>
