[19:23] Aisha: Anyone else's lights flickering in Whitechapel?

[19:24] Tariq: Yeah, same here near Brick Lane. Third time this week.

[19:25] Mrs. Kumar: The bakery's power went out completely. Had to close early. Something's not right.

[19:26] Naila: Just passed Roman Road Market. Everyone's talking about strange feelings in their bones. Like a vibration.

[19:28] Dr. Chen (GP): Getting more patients with these symptoms at the surgery. Official line is "mass hysteria" but I'm not so sure.

[19:30] Aisha: My cousin works at Royal London. Says A&E is packed with similar cases.

[19:35] Tariq: Found this on Reddit - apparently ONYXBONE isn't just here. Reports from NYC, Tokyo, Mumbai...

[19:40] Mrs. Kumar: My grandmother used to say animals know when something big is coming...

[21:03] Tariq: BREAKING: BBC News reporting nationwide power fluctuations. Government calling emergency COBRA meeting.

[21:45] Aisha: My brother at the Met says they're getting ready for something big. Extra patrols everywhere.

[22:15] Naila: Just heard a sound... like a deep hum. Anyone else?
