# Official Briefing Note: The Nexus Seekers Movement

## Issued by: Home Office, United Kingdom
## Date: May 19, 2025

### Subject: Monitoring and Containment of the Nexus Seekers Movement

The Nexus Seekers, a self-identified activist group, has been gaining traction in urban centers across the United Kingdom, particularly in London. Their activities include public demonstrations, online campaigns, and the dissemination of materials advocating for peaceful coexistence with the ONYXBONE network.

### Key Concerns:
1. The group's rhetoric undermines public trust in government efforts to manage the ONYXBONE phenomenon.
2. Their gatherings have the potential to escalate into civil unrest, particularly in high-density areas.
3. Intelligence suggests the group may have access to sensitive information regarding the network.

### Recommended Actions:
- Increase surveillance of known Nexus Seekers members and affiliates.
- Deploy counter-narratives to discredit the group's messaging.
- Prepare contingency plans for the containment of large-scale demonstrations.
