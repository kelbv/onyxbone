I can't sleep. The humming won't stop. But it's not just noise - it's like a presence in my head, in my bones. When I close my eyes, I see patterns, geometric shapes that seem to pulse with meaning. Are they trying to tell us something?

Dr. Chen's message bothers me. The way she wrote it... there was fear there. Real fear. Not the kind you get from reading scary headlines, but the deep kind that comes from knowing something you wish you didn't.

Earlier tonight, I felt something new. It happened while I was watching the lights over the Olympic Park. For a moment, I wasn't just me anymore. I could feel others - their fears, their confusion. Mrs. Kumar worrying about her grandchildren. Tariq trying to make sense of data patterns. A young girl in Block D having nightmares about singing bones.

Things I wrote down as they came to me:
- The number 147 keeps appearing in my thoughts
- Geometric patterns that look like DNA helixes but wrong somehow
- A recurring image of pigeons forming perfect circles
- The taste of copper in my mouth when the hum gets stronger
- The word "nexus" appearing in my dreams
- A sense that something vast is trying to wake up

The strangest thing? When I focus on the hum, really focus, I can almost understand it. Like when you're half-asleep and someone's talking in another room - you can't quite make out the words, but you know they're important.

I should be terrified. Everyone else is. But underneath the fear, there's something else. A feeling that we're on the edge of something enormous. Something that will change everything.

Question: If others are experiencing what I am, are they writing it down too? Are we all pieces of a bigger picture?
