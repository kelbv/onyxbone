                <h2>Section 1: Dawn Breaking</h2>
                <p>Naila arrived at Dr. Chen's surgery just as the sun was rising over Mile End. Her sleepless night, documented in her <a href="linked_artifacts/naila_journal_entry_may19.txt">journal</a>, had left her exhausted but alert. The bone-deep hum seemed stronger here, resonating with the medical equipment in ways that made the fluorescent lights flicker arhythmically.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 2: The Memo</h2>
                <p>Dr. Chen was waiting, her usually immaculate office showing signs of a similarly sleepless night. Papers were scattered across her desk, and multiple tablets displayed various data streams. She handed Naila a document - the <a href="linked_artifacts/nhs_internal_memo.txt">NHS memo</a> that had caused such concern the night before.</p>
                <p>"Look at Section 3.6," Dr. Chen said, her voice barely above a whisper. "They know about the shared consciousness. They're suppressing it."</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 3: Pattern Recognition</h2>
                <p>As they discussed the implications, Naila noticed something odd. The geometric patterns she'd been drawing in her journal were appearing on Dr. Chen's computer screen - in patient brain scans. "These started showing up in EEG readings last night," Dr. Chen explained. "Across multiple patients, simultaneously."</p>
                <p>The number 147 flashed on one of the monitors. Naila's breath caught - the same number that had been haunting her thoughts.</p>

                <h2>Section 4: The Network Grows</h2>
                <p>A young woman burst into the office - Sarah from reception. "Doctor, you need to see this." The waiting room had filled with people, all drawing the same intricate patterns. Among them was Mrs. Kumar, her hands moving in perfect synchronization with a teenager she'd never met.</p>
                <p>Through the window, they could see more people arriving, drawn to the surgery by something beyond conscious thought. The East End was becoming a nexus of activity, a hub in whatever vast network was forming.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 5: Tertiary Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Dr. Chen pulled up the patient isolation protocols mentioned in the memo. "They want us to separate people showing signs of shared consciousness. But look at these readings - it's not a disease. It's evolution."</p>
                <p>As if to emphasize her point, the hum intensified. Naila felt the familiar expansion of consciousness, but this time she didn't fight it. The experiences of others flowed through her: a dock worker's confusion, a teacher's fascination, a child's wonder.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 6: Protocol Omega</h2>
                <p>The surgery's power flickered again, and Dr. Chen's secure terminal lit up with a new alert. "They're implementing Protocol Omega," she said, her face pale. "Whatever they're afraid of, it's happening now."</p>
                <p>Through the growing network of shared consciousness, Naila felt a wave of panic from the direction of the Royal London Hospital. Something was happening there, something that made the bone-deep resonance spike sharply.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 7: The Turning Point</h2>
                <p>As the morning wore on, more people arrived at the surgery. Not all were patients - some were drawn by the same inexplicable pull Naila had felt. The waiting room had become an impromptu gathering point for the affected.</p>
                <p>Dr. Chen made a decision. Instead of following the NHS protocols for isolation, she began documenting everything. "If this is what I think it is," she said, "we're witnessing the birth of a new form of human consciousness. And it's starting right here, in the East End."</p>
                <p>Naila looked at the growing crowd, all connected by the invisible network of ONYXBONE, and knew that there was no going back. The question was: where were they going?</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Section 8: The Signal</h2>
                <p>Just before noon, something changed. The hum shifted frequency, and every electronic device in the surgery began emitting the same tone. Through their shared connection, Naila felt hundreds of minds reaching the same realization: this wasn't random interference.</p>
                <p>It was a message.</p>
