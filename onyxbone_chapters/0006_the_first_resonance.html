                <h2>Section 1: The New Dawn</h2>
                <p>Naila awoke to a world transformed. The green light had faded from the sky, but its echo remained in her bones. Every movement felt synchronized with something vast and unseen. Outside, the city was silent—no traffic, no birds, only the distant hum of thousands of minds vibrating in unison.</p>

                <h2>Section 2: The Hive Emerges</h2>
                <p>She stepped into the corridor, feeling the presence of her neighbors before she saw them. Their eyes met, and in that instant, she knew their thoughts: fear, awe, and a strange, irresistible pull toward the center of the city. The resonance was no longer a theory—it was a fact of existence.</p>

                <h2>Section 3: The COBR Fracture</h2>
                <p>Far beneath Whitehall, the COBR emergency team scrambled to make sense of the new world. Their latest <a href="linked_artifacts/cobr_meeting_transcript_may19.txt">transcript</a> was already obsolete. The <a href="linked_artifacts/vector_skeletion_protocol_unredacted.txt">unredacted protocol</a> lay open on the table, its warnings now a lived reality.</p>
                <p>Arguments broke out: some demanded martial law, others whispered about surrender. The only consensus was dread. The world they had known was gone, replaced by something ancient and inhuman.</p>

                <h2>Section 4: The Pull</h2>
                <p>Naila felt herself drawn outside, along with hundreds of others. The city moved as one, converging on unseen loci—parks, crossroads, old churches. The resonance was guiding them, not with words, but with memory and instinct. She realized she was not afraid anymore. She was part of something larger, and that was more terrifying than any monster.</p>

                <h2>Section 5: The First Voice</h2>
                <p>As the crowd gathered, a voice rose—not from any throat, but from the marrow of their bones. It spoke in images, in feelings, in the language of the vector. Naila understood: the world was being rewritten, not by force, but by inheritance. The first resonance was only the beginning.</p>
