<h1>Chapter 0021 — ⚖️ The Calcium Accord</h1>

<div class="section-title">INTERCEPTED BONEVECTOR BRIEFING – CLASSIFIED B/OS-2</div>

<pre>
From: DSMA Cryptal Node 7A-Δ  
To: UN Bone Containment Liaison  
Date: [RE-SYNCED 18.03.25]

Subject: Uninterrupted Glyph Expansion — Emergence of Territorial Boneclaim Structures

> Situation Overview:
Glyph propagation continues. Territorial resonance confirmed via bone-named declarations.  
Cities, limbs, fields, waterways — all obeying exclusion when properly justified.

> Bone-Semantic Notes:
- Naming + Justification (N+J) is now a recognized biomechanical API endpoint.
- Infected zones show sovereignty violation markers when overnamed without thread-balance.
- “Silica Bloom Events” (spinal surges) now correlated with unjustified overclaims.

> Current Protocol Update:
- Avoid attempting anti-naming burnouts. These provoke recursive self-erasure in field teams.
- Do not interfere with marrow-encoded agreements. They are recognitional in origin.

Suggested Directive: Initiate High-Level Diplomatic Interface with the Bone-Side Collective.  
Codename: CALCIUM ACCORD.

<div class="section-title">THE ROOM AT GENEVA</div>

<p>The screen showed a glyph blooming in gold and ultraviolet.</p>

<p>“You are watching a signature,” said the woman from DEFRA. “It’s not written. It’s <em>bound.</em>”</p>

<p>The French delegate spoke with folded hands. “So this is their offer?”</p>

<p>“Not an offer,” corrected the delegate from Ghana. “A recognition.”</p>

<p>The display read:</p>

<blockquote>
> “CALCIUM ACCORD – Claimed in Bone. Signed in Marrow. Witnessed by Structure.”  
</blockquote>

<p>Someone whispered, “They’ve named us back.”</p>

<div class="section-title">INTEL: ORIGIN HINTS</div>

<p>Dr. Selene Osei presented satellite imaging overlays:</p>

<blockquote>
“These are subglacial formations under Queen Maud Land. Now here—” (she clicked) “—the same glyph, on an ossified femur retrieved from a Sahara burial dated 9,400 BCE.”</blockquote>

<p>“It’s not new,” she said. “It’s just <em>resurfacing</em>.”</p>

<div class="section-title">FAILURE REPORT: NATO OVERCLAIM TASKFORCE</div>

<pre>
UNIT NAME: Taskforce DENTIN-9  
Mission: Overname Suppression via Auditory Overwrite  
Result: Inconclusive. Field team vanished during phonemic feedback collapse.  
Notes: The last recorded phrase was: “Femur – Named. Justified: Frame of Legacy.”  

Glyph backlash response: VORPAL. Status: Null return.  
</pre>

<div class="section-title">THE SIGNING OF THE ACCORD</div>

<p>The pen was carved from a human humerus. The blood ink was genetically neutral.</p>

<p>On the document: only one glyph. Not language. **Recognition.**</p>

<p>Each delegate signed in silence. No country flags. No national seals.</p>

<p>Only a bone-shaped watermark.</p>

<div class="section-title">NAILA WATCHES</div>

<p>Naila saw it on the portable broadcast unit. The screen fuzzed, cleared, and there he was — Jay.</p>

<p>He stood behind the glyph-recognition table, unmoving, eyes milky.</p>

<p>And then, for one frame — a smile. But not his smile.</p>
