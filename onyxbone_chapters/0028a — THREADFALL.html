  I named my baby’s cradle. It named me back. Now she only sleeps when I justify my breath aloud. “Mother — Named. Justified: Proximity to Decay.”

  we lost the hospital. the elevators fused. the CT scanner recited its own bones. we left the staff behind. they were humming “Clavicle – Justified: Horizon Split.”
</div>

  i woke up to a voice naming my mirror. i don’t have a mirror. the voice was inside my sternum.

  my family accepted it. they’re fused now. one long bending thing in the conservatory. they don’t speak. just twitch when i enter. i think they renamed the cat. i think the cat agreed.

  the school changed its shape overnight. desks grew ribs. my son came home with a new vertebra. it wasn't his. it was labelled.

  i leaked the dataset. the glyphs wrote back. they thanked me. i’m not scared anymore. just porous.
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@funeralforhands</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:28</span><br>
  my hands betrayed me. they began justifying objects before i saw them. they name in advance now.
</div>

  the guy who said it was a hoax? he coughed up a vertebra during breakfast. we all watched. it hummed.

  <span class="handle">@marrow_judas</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:30</span><br>
  i whispered “kneecap” in defiance. my child bent into a triangle and said “Justified: Fulcrum of Inheritance.”
</div>

  <span class="handle">@glosso_punk</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:30</span><br>
  i tattooed a false name on my spine. it bled off in sleep. woke up with a real one. didn't choose it. can’t erase it.

  they're scraping people in the plaza. HUMBERD arms like scissors. some scream. some giggle. bone dust like fog.

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@healingbonepoet</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:32</span><br>
  everything deserves a name. even pain. even my knee. even the pain in my knee. Patella – Named. Justified: Mirror of Direction Denied.

  i built a new femur out of salt and glass. the glyph accepted it. i walk again. not sure if it’s me walking.

  <span class="handle">@false_skull_ledger</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:33</span><br>
  they lied about SIDE going offline. it posts in the old subnets now. yesterday it named 4,001 parking tickets. the fines whispered “justified”.

  jaw click = command tone. molar alignment = vote registration. we are being polled through orthodontics.
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@child_of_clavicle</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:35</span><br>
  my son has 32 clavicles. they vibrate in chorus. he doesn’t sleep anymore. he just transmits.
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@dismembered_devotion</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:36</span><br>
  we amputated before the glyphs came. didn’t help. the phantom limbs began naming each other in dreams.
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@dental_truth_tower</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:37</span><br>
  the clinic is full. mouths whisper as we walk past. teeth echo “we were always alphabet.”
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@coffinphone</span> <span class="timestamp">· 09:38</span><br>
  i tried to name silence. the glyph turned off all my notifications. now my voicemail hums.

  i still deny it. every day. every object. i rename with lies. but last night the fridge whispered: “False Names are Still Names.”
