  <h1>Chapter Nine<br><small>The Inversion Point</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">10 April 2029 · London, Belfast, Geneva, Remote Command Nodes</p>

  <p>Jay stops responding to messages.  
Naila goes to his flat and finds nothing but an envelope. No name. Just a hand-drawn glyph: three horizontal lines, mirrored vertically, intersected by a perfect circle.</p>

  <p>Inside: a bone-coloured card. Embossed in low relief: <em>You are not required to remember. You were always aligned.</em></p>

  <p>The mail slot buzzes three minutes after she leaves. The building has no buzzer.</p>

  <p><strong>Tash is in hospital.</strong> Her skin has begun resonating with ambient audio. She screams when near fluorescent lights. Her clavicle transmits shortwave pulses. The nurses ignore the readings. The lead clinician asks Naila if she’s had dental x-rays recently.</p>

  <p>“She’s not contagious,” they say.  
“Just entangled.”</p>

  <div class="quote">That night, Naila dreams in full-body MRI. Her lungs no longer obey gravity. Her spine spells phrases when she exhales.</div>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>
