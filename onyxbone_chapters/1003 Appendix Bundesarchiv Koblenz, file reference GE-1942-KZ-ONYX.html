TO: SS-Obersturmbannführer Wilhelm Schuster (Ahnenerbe)
FROM: Dr. Erwin Messner, Osteo-Linguistic Section, Tiergartenstraße 4
RE: Unusual Resonant Activity Within Prisoner Cadavers

Obersturmbannführer,

Following your directive to assess material suitability for the "Schädelplatten" research protocols, I conducted an osteo-density sweep of cadaver batch T42-B (Jewish and Romani inmates, Berlin and Kraków origin).

Of 98 samples processed, 7 displayed unexplained harmonic flicker during cold-scanning. Initially assumed to be equipment calibration failure — however, I personally verified all volt-chains.

Each of the 7 bones — exclusively femurs and mandibles — exhibited a sub-audible tonal hum when exposed to tungsten vapor.

More troubling:
Under basic spectrographic light, a symbol appeared faintly in 3 samples:

    — three converging lines
    — intersecting at a non-Euclidean angle
    — almost like a sigil, but not occult in our usual typologies

Prisoner records showed no common origin, language, or faith. But all 7 had one documented phrase scrawled on their bedframes:

"Name the bone or be named by it."

This phrase was not recorded by guards, but recovered through latent graphite dust analysis.

Ahnenerbe Response:
Initial reports were dismissed. However, Standartenführer Lützow observed:
“These markings and frequencies may not be mystical, but structural. Architectural. The body is inscribing something it cannot hold.”

Counter-Measure Suggestion:
Due to uncontained glyph formation risk, recommend immediate cremation of anomalous samples.
Ahnenerbe archivists have already requisitioned the sigils under seal.

Unofficial Note:
I believe the bones are speaking.
We are only hearing the preamble.

Signed,
Dr. Erwin Messner
Krankenbau Experimental Wing

Enclosure: 3 graphite rubbings (REDACTED)
