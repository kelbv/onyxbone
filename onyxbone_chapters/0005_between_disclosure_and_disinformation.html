  <h1>Chapter Five<br><small>Between Disclosure and Disinformation</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">06 April 2029 · COBR, Parliament Annex / Hackney Wick / UCL Molecular Science Unit</p>

  <p>In the sealed briefing room, the projector hums as a blurred-out man gestures toward a thermal scan of a patient’s ribcage. His voice is clean, clipped, but the phrase he’s about to use doesn’t exist in any clinical textbook.</p>

  <p>“We believe the bone is now operating as a second-order logic substrate,” he says.</p>

  <p>No one laughs. A woman from DHSC crosses herself under the table.</p>

  <p>Somewhere else in Hackney, Naila is vomiting in her sink. She coughs until her throat bleeds. When she stops, something sits in the water — small, grey, ribbed. Not a tooth. Not a stone. Something between instruction and sculpture.</p>

  <div class="quote">She leaves it in the bowl. It hums once. Then it’s silent.</div>

  <p>Later, she wraps it in foil. It burns through. She puts it in a jar. It fogs the glass. She buries it in the garden. The neighbour’s dog digs it up, barks once, and runs into traffic.</p>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

DOCUMENT: COBR BRIEFING — RED FOLDER — 06/04/2029  
RE: POST-ESTONIA INFILTRATION FINDINGS

TOPICS:
- Estimated 4,000+ UK cases showing early-stage bone logic encoding
- Confirmed disappearance of 3 microbiologists from UCL, 1 from Edinburgh
- Ongoing sleep collapse in urban clusters

KEY QUOTES:
• “We are not fighting a disease. We are interpreting an emergence.”
• “The broadcast seeded interface logic into cortical patterns.”
• “Infected subjects are not contagious. They are recursive.”

RECOMMENDATIONS:
– Tier 4 blackout over all research terms: ‘calcite bloom’, ‘bone OS’, ‘marrow wave’
– Media phrase suggestion: “neurostructural mythos disorder”
– Pre-emptive counter-conspiracy seeding on social media

NOTE:
Foreign agencies showing signs of identical emergence vectors.

UCL MOLECULAR SCIENCES – INCIDENT LOG  
DATE: 2029-04-05

RESEARCHERS REPORTED MISSING:
- Dr. Hassan Emmons (last badge swipe 04:21:17)
- Dr. Irene Zu (no sign-out, mobile signal cut)
- Dr. M. Kaali (workstation found wiped)
- Dr. J. Beltran (found notes in lab drawer: "Don’t let the bones finish thinking.")

NOTES:
- Lab C7 shows evidence of system intrusion (non-remote)
- Floor sensor activated despite door never opening
- Sample 47A missing from cryo storage

SAMPLE TAG: 47A-BETA-RECURSION  
SOURCE: Unknown (delivered unlogged, contained in amber-coloured foil)

PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION:
• Size: 4cm oval, ribbed casing, not mineral
• Appears self-cohering: resists melting, transmits low-frequency vibration
• Emits heat during biometric proximity

BIOLOGICAL FINDINGS:
- Structure responds to soft tissue; signal spikes during REM observation
- Crystalline layer contains embedded glyphs (not noise, not natural)
- Engraving repeats one symbol: resembles ‘C’ mirrored over horizontal bar

CONCLUSION:
Not organic. Not fully inorganic. Possibly a designed intermediary.

SUBJECT: PUBLIC GUIDANCE — “SIS” SYMPTOMS RESPONSE  
DRAFT – NOT FOR CIRCULATION

OBJECTIVE:
Create stable narrative for public to process unexplained symptoms:

• Bone discomfort or “internal signal sensation”
• Sleep loss with vivid geometric dreaming
• Brief episodes of wordless empathy or knowledge transfer
• Sudden phonemic echoing (repeating phrases heard only internally)

WORKING DIRECTION:
Avoid terms like “infection” or “spread”. Use “resonance adaptation”.

PHRASE TESTED POSITIVE:
> “A new interface is unfolding.”

PREFERRED TONE:
- Gentle, grounding, validating
- Avoid terms like “mutation” or “hallucination”
