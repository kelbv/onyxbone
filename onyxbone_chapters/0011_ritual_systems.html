MAP: GLYPH-SYNC INFRASTRUCTURE VS GEOSTRATEGIC ALIGNMENT  
SOURCE: MI6 / SHADOWCABINET ARCHIVE

HIGHLIGHTS:
• Glyph hubs aligned with former telecom signal towers
• France, Korea, Israel show high glyph density overlap with national broadcast relays

CONCLUSION:
The war is infrastructural. The battle is semantic.
