I’m writing this before it fades again.

The hum is stronger now. It's like when you hold your breath too long and your body starts blinking inside you. That’s what my hands feel like. The bones underneath are buzzing — not vibrating — buzzing. Like they’re **waiting**.

I remembered something that isn’t mine: a hallway with numbers that counted up and *backward* at the same time. I was inside someone else. But I was watching.

Dean said it’s anxiety. Jay said it's 5G.

But I think something’s being written inside me.
