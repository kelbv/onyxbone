        A handheld camera captures shaky footage of a hospital corridor. Fluorescent lights flicker erratically. A FIGURE shuffles into frame, movements jerky and unnatural. As they approach, their bones glow faintly through their skin, casting angular shadows. They speak in a distorted, multi-tonal voice.

    <div class="scene-heading">ACT ONE</div>
    <div class="action">FADE IN:</div>
    <div class="scene-heading">INT. THE GOLDEN CONDOR PUB - NIGHT</div>
    <div class="action">
        The pub is alive with chatter and the clink of glasses. NAILA, early 30s, sharp-eyed but weary, sits at a booth with DEAN and JAY, both around her age. They’re mid-conversation, but Naila stares at the foam in her pint, lost in thought.
    </div>
    <div class="character">DEAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (leaning in)<br>
        You alright? You’ve been quiet all night.
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        Yeah, just… been having weird dreams lately.
    </div>
    <div class="character">JAY</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        What kind of dreams?
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        Hard to explain. Like, I hear this humming sound, and my bones feel like they’re vibrating.
    </div>
    <div class="character">DEAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (laughs)<br>
        Sounds like you need to lay off the late-night horror flicks.
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        It’s not funny. It feels real.
    </div>
    <div class="action">
        The TV in the corner switches to a muted Sky News broadcast. Patrons turn to watch as captions flicker: “BREAKING - UNVERIFIED FOOTAGE LEAKED FROM TALLINN HOSPITAL - UK GOVT REFUSES COMMENT.” The screen replays the teaser footage—glowing bones, distorted words.
    </div>
    <div class="character">JAY</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        What the hell is that?
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (staring, hushed)<br>
        That’s… that’s what I saw in my dream.

    <div class="character">DEAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        You’re kidding.
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        No, I’m serious. This is exactly it.
    </div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila stands abruptly, pale and shaken, and heads for the door.

    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        I need some air.

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. THE GOLDEN CONDOR PUB - NIGHT</div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila steps into the cool night, breathing deeply. She glances at her wrist—a faint, glyph-like mark pulses under her skin. She whispers to herself.

    <div class="character">NAILA</div>

        What is happening to me?

    <div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT</div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila tosses in bed, restless. She bolts upright, grabs her phone, and searches “Tallinn hospital leak.” A conspiracy forum pops up with a post: “Vector Skeletion Protocol—biological override in bones. Classified.” Her screen glitches; a glyph flashes briefly.
    </div>
    <div class="action">
        A faint hum fills the room. Naila shivers, clutching her wrist where the mark glows stronger.
    </div>
    <div class="scene-heading">INT. HOSPITAL - LONDON - DAY</div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila sits in a sterile waiting room, anxious. She’s ushered into the doctor’s office.
    </div>
    <div class="scene-heading">INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY</div>
    <div class="action">
        DOCTOR, 50s, examines Naila’s wrist. The glyph mark is vivid now.
    </div>
    <div class="character">DOCTOR</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        This is unusual. Looks like a tattoo, but you say it just appeared?
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        Yes, overnight. And I’ve been feeling… vibrations in my bones. Hearing a hum.
    </div>
    <div class="character">DOCTOR</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        I’ll order tests. Rest for now.
    </div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila nods, unconvinced, and leaves.
    </div>
    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY</div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila walks past a newsstand—headlines scream about Tallinn and global anomalies. She overhears a conversation at a café.

    <div class="character">MAN</div>
    <div class="dialogue">

        Mind control experiment gone wrong, I reckon.

        Or aliens. Who knows?

        Naila shakes her head, but the doubt lingers.

        Naila pores over a laptop, reading a redacted leak about “Vector Skeletion Protocol.” Her phone rings—it’s Dean.

    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        (answering)<br>
        Hey, Dean.

    <div class="character">DEAN (V.O.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        Naila, you okay? You bolted last night.
    </div>
    <div class="character">NAILA</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        I’m fine. Just figuring this out.
    </div>
    <div class="character">DEAN (V.O.)</div>
    <div class="dialogue">
        That news was freaky. Come over if you need to talk.

    <div class="dialogue">
        Maybe later. Thanks.

    <div class="action">
        She hangs up. Her laptop flickers; the Tallinn footage plays unbidden. The FIGURE stares at the camera.

        The screen cuts out. Naila recoils as the hum grows louder in her ears.

    <div class="scene-heading">EXT. LONDON PARK - DAY</div>
    <div class="action">
        Naila walks, distracted, and spots a STREET ARTIST drawing glyphs on the pavement. One matches her wrist. She approaches.

        Excuse me, what are you drawing?

        Naila sleeps fitfully. In her dream, she’s in a dark room with glowing skeletons chanting.

        Trigram. Bone. Mirror. Initiate.

        Naila tries to run but can’t. The chanting intensifies; her bones vibrate. She wakes, sweating, and checks her wrist—the glyph glows brightly. In the bathroom mirror, her eyes flicker with faint light.

    <div class="action">
        A VOICE echoes in her head, calm and commanding.
