        Chaos reigns in a bustling newsroom. Reporters shout over each other, phones ring incessantly, and screens display the viral Tallinn hospital footage. A frazzled EDITOR slams a phone down.

        Sir, there’s a new leak. A whistleblower posted this on a darknet forum.

        You’re saying this thing just appeared overnight? And now you’re hearing voices?

        Not voices, exactly. It’s more like a hum, but it feels… meaningful.

        Whoa, check this out. A darknet forum has a thread called "Vector Skeletion Protocol." It’s full of leaks and conspiracy theories.

    <div class="character">JAY</div>

        It’s a classified project—something about a biological override protocol that turns bones into transmitters. There’s talk of glyphs, harmonics, and a global network.

        Naila examines her arm—the glyph now extends to her elbow. She looks pale and shaken.
