            A series of rapid, unsettling vignettes illustrating the global spread:
            *   **ARGENTINA:** Thousands of people, young and old, are sprawled across a Mendoza park, drawing complex bone-glyphs on the ground with chalk, dirt, even their own blood. Their movements are synchronized, a quiet, trance-like communion.
            *   **FINLAND:** A fighter jet flies over a snow-covered landscape. Below, massive, glowing glyphs are etched into the ice. The PILOT (O.S.) screams over the radio, her voice breaking up, describing her memory disintegrating, "losing words." The jet banks sharply, erratically.
            *   **NIGERIA:** In the Lagos underground, a group of people, eyes closed, sway and hum. Their collective hum is broadcast through the public transit PA system, a deep, resonant tone that causes others on the platform to sway involuntarily, their jaws clicking.
            *   **UK:** A group of schoolchildren in Bristol's playground, kneeling, meticulously recreating the failed UN speech word for word, in chalk. Not drawing, but *transcribing*.
