            In a London gripped by unseen forces, a young woman begins to hear a hum beneath the mundane, leading her to a terrifying truth: her own bones are waking up, aligning with a global, non-biological intelligence.

            The air is thick with the scent of stale oil, a faint tang of disinfectant, and the lingering aroma of cheap fried food. A dozen voices, mostly men, blur into a single, boisterous current. DULL THUDS of boots on old floorboards punctuate the din.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Two ancient televisions hang from the corners. One blares football, volume too high. The other is MUTED, displaying SKY NEWS captions, flickering like a frantic, trapped moth.

            NAILA (20s), a woman with sharp, observant eyes, watches the foam in her pint of Guinness collapse. It deflates slowly, like lungs under pressure. She doesn't blink.

            Dean snorts, a mouthful of burger. Naila doesn't laugh. Not this time. She swears she saw something in her X-ray last week. Something geometric. Her GP called it "artefact contamination." Recommended switching clinics. She remembers the way the radiologist's face went pale.

            The screen shows a grainy, handheld, SHAKY CAMERA feed. Harsh fluorescents. A FIGURE shuffles. Their bones cast shadows INSIDE their body – angular, branching. The image JUDDERS.

Like they're waiting. I remembered something that isn't mine: a hallway with numbers that counted up and backward at the same time. I was inside someone else. But I was watching. Dean said it's anxiety. Jay said it's 5G. But I think something's being written inside me."</span>
