            Naila is leaning over her kitchen sink, coughing. Her throat is raw. She coughs until she tastes more blood. When she finally stops, something sits in the water.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Small, grey, ribbed. Not a tooth. Not a stone. Something between instruction and sculpture. It seems to pulse with a faint, internal light.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            She stares at it, transfixed. A low hum emanates from it. Then it's silent.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Her hands are shaking. She picks it up with a paper towel. It feels warm. She wraps it in foil.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            A moment later, a thin plume of SMOKE rises from the foil. It's burning through.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Panicked, Naila finds an old glass jar, drops the object inside, and screws the lid on tight.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Immediately, the glass FOGS, as if from extreme cold, then begins to CRACK. A faint HUMMING sound emits from the jar.
        </div>

        <div class="scene-heading">EXT. NAILA'S GARDEN - CONTINUOUS</div>
        <div class="action">
            Naila rushes outside, digging frantically in the small, overgrown garden. She buries the jar deep.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            She barely finishes covering it when the NEIGHBOR'S DOG, a scruffy terrier, bursts through the fence, barking furiously. It digs at the freshly turned earth, scrabbling with frantic paws.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            It unearths the jar. The glass is now shattered. The small, ribbed object sits there, glowing faintly. The dog sniffs it, then lets out a single, piercing BARK.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Its eyes, usually a mischievous brown, are now wide, milky. It whines, then turns and BOLTS into the busy street.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            A BLARING HORN. A SCREECH OF TIRES. A sickening THUD.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Naila freezes, eyes wide. The silence that follows is profound.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            She looks at the broken jar, at the pulsing object, then back at the street, where a small crowd has gathered around the dog. Its body is still. But a faint HUM pulses from where it lies.
        </div>
        <div class="action">
            Naila touches her own ribs. The hum is stronger now. It’s inside everything. It’s inside *her*.
        </div>

        <div class="transition">FADE TO BLACK.</div>

        <div class="cue">
            (SOUND: A low, rhythmic THUMM, like a distant, massive heartbeat, accompanied by faint, almost subliminal whispers.)
        </div>
