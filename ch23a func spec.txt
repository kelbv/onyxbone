Certainly. Based on the ONYXBONE schema and Chapter 23a's described role in the infection arc, here is a **full functional specification** for the **Chapter 23a – Auto-Nomenclature Feedback** web page. This document serves both as a blueprint for implementation and a QA reference.

# 🩻 **Functional Specification for Chapter 23a – Auto-Nomenclature Feedback**

## 📄 Overview

Chapter 23a is a **dynamically generated HTML5 interactive page** embedded within the ONYXBONE narrative arc. It represents a key infection pivot where the naming-justification mechanic becomes recursive and compulsive. It simulates the **feedback loop** wherein readers/users name bones or concepts and receive glyphs in return. These glyphs recursively prompt further naming.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

* Visually and functionally immerse the user in recursive naming/justification.
* Simulate a living bone network that **responds to user input**.
* Reinforce themes of **self-overwriting**, **obsession**, and **symbolic infection**.
* Act as an entry point to a **networked glyph-feedback engine**.

---

## 🧩 Key Functional Components

### 1. **Interactive Naming Engine**

* **Input fields** for:

  * **Name** (free text input)
  * **Justification** (free text input)
* **Submit button** triggers rendering of:

  * A new **named node**
  * A corresponding **glyph**
  * An animated **resonance wave** to surrounding nodes

### 2. **Visual Bone-Network Graph**

* Canvas-based or SVG-based graph:

  * Pulsing nodes representing named entities
  * Hovering shows justification
  * Nodes are animated to appear bone-like
* Nodes expand autonomously every `5–10s`:

  * Based on dictionary seeding of bones, diseases, places, items
  * Autonomously generate names and glyphs if idle

### 3. **Resonance Feedback Animation**

* Upon each valid naming:

  * Local node pulses with glow
  * Nearby nodes react with reduced intensity
  * A **glyph bloom** (e.g., ❖, ☌, 🜁) overlays the node temporarily
* These animations reinforce:

  * Marrow-thread cohesion
  * Glyph-network awareness

### 4. **Recursive Engine Growth**

* After X user inputs, a **‘Justification Spiral’** effect:

  * Rapid autonomous spawning of named nodes
  * Connections between semantically similar entries
  * Fractal bloom effect in background

## 🧠 Data Structures (Internal)

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "femur_01",
      "name": "Femur",
      "justification": "Bearing of Lineage",
      "glyph": "🜃",
      "x": 345,
      "y": 281,
      "timestamp": "2025-05-21T20:15:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "links": [
    { "source": "femur_01", "target": "tibia_03", "resonance": 0.7 }
  ]
}
```

## 🌐 UI/UX Requirements

* ⚙️ **Responsive Design**:

  * Works on desktop and mobile
  * Graph scales fluidly with viewport

* 🧩 **Visual Language**:

  * Monospace font (for ritual/terminal feel)
  * Muted palette (bone beige, blood red, glyph indigo)
  * Canvas elements blend into body scroll

* 🕸️ **Micro-interactions**:

  * Typing a name suggests dictionary completions
  * Justification glow when equal syllabic weight is achieved
  * Subtle auditory feedback (clicks, pulses) optional

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

* **Technology stack**:

  * HTML5 + CSS3
  * Vanilla JS (or D3.js for graph engine)
  * Optional localStorage for session naming memory

* **Dependencies**:

  * Unicode glyph set
  * Optional: JS thesaurus/dictionary API (local JSON fallback)

* **Accessibility**:

  * Keyboard-navigable
  * ARIA labels for input fields and interactive nodes

## 🧪 Validation & Edge Cases

| Scenario                    | Expected Behaviour                              |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Empty name or justification | Highlight input field in red                    |
| Duplicate name              | Add index suffix, e.g., `Femur (2)`             |
| Very long justification     | Scrolls inside tooltip or modal                 |
| Invalid characters          | Prevent submission, error flash                 |
| Excessive activity          | Slow autonomous growth rate, fade distant nodes |

---

## 📉 Performance

* Max node count: 300 (then older nodes fade)
* Node pulse rate throttled after 2 minutes idle
* Avoids infinite recursion by tracking input lineage

---

## 🔐 Optional Lore Embed

Each session could end with:

> *“You have named 18. You are now bound by 18. Their glyphs have entered your marrow.”*

Would you like a working **HTML prototype** for this now or separately render a static fallback version for non-JS users?
