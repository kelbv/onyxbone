  <h1>Chapter Four<br><small>A Body is a Host</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">05 April 2029 · Hackney Wick / Government Secure Intranet / NHS Internal MemoChain</p>

  <p>Naila dreams of something pressing outwards from her spine. Not pain — not quite. A pressure that wants language. That wants to sing.</p>

  <p>She wakes to blood in her mouth. She checks her teeth in the mirror. They look... longer. Sharper? She presses gently with her fingertip. They *flex*.</p>

  <p>The bathroom floor vibrates slightly. She assumes it's the train line. She hopes it’s the train line.</p>

  <p>Downstairs, someone across the street is screaming. But not out loud — not exactly. The sound is inside her jaw, vibrating the hinge. A hum, like a modem handshake from 1997. Except she’s the wire.</p>

  <div class="quote">“It’s not pain,” she whispers. “It’s... installation.”</div>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

I don't remember falling asleep. I remember the taste of salt and copper.  
I remember my tongue spelling out something on the roof of my mouth.  
It wasn’t English. It was *calcium logic*.

My molars hurt. They feel like they're shifting. Or talking.

And when I opened my phone, my Notes app had a file titled "accept_me_final".  
I didn’t write it. But it’s in my style.

UK SLEEP CLINICS – AGGREGATE DATA (MARCH–APRIL 2029)

FINDING:
Insomnia incidence has risen 600% in 19–34 year-olds in urban areas.

ANOMALIES:
• Subjects report being “held awake from the inside”
• Many exhibit micro-temporal disassociation (looped movements, echo gestures)
• Most can’t recall dreams — but can repeat exact phrases in non-native phonemes

Most common phrase recorded (unconsciously vocalised):
> “Do not contain. Configure me.”

RECOMMENDATION:
Do not issue public guidance yet. Risk of mass psychogenic escalation.
Refer cases with mirror fixation or bone-signal dreams to Tier 3 clinics.
