  <h1>Chapter One<br><small>The Whisper Beneath the Bone</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">21:12 BST · The Golden Condor · Bethnal Green · East London</p>

  <p>The pub smells of burnt oil, urinal pucks, and undercooked chicken. A dozen voices layer over each other, interrupted only by the dull thud of boots on old floorboards. Televisions hang from two corners. One's on football. The other is muted — tuned to Sky News, captions flickering like something gasping for signal.</p>

  <p>Naila watches the foam in her pint collapse like lungs under pressure. She doesn’t blink for a while.</p>

  <p>“You alright?” Dean asks, leaning in, chin still greasy from his double cheeseburger.</p>

  <p>“Yeah.”</p>

  <p>She’s not. Not since the dreams started. Not since she began hearing <strong>the hum</strong> just before waking — low, persistent, like someone whispering into her spine.</p>

  <div class="quote">“It’s just— I dunno. Everything’s too loud lately.”</div>

  <p>Jay shrugs. “It’s the algorithm. Probably scraping our brainwaves now. What’s one more leak?”</p>

  <p>“No, it’s that Estonia thing.” Aadam, who no one remembers inviting, leans forward. “That’s real. My cousin’s in Narva. She says they’re closing clinics. Government’s pretending it’s tuberculosis but... people’ve got light coming out their mouths.”</p>

  <p>Dean laughs, but Naila doesn’t. Not this time. She swears she saw something in her X-ray last week. Something geometric. Her GP called it "artefact contamination." Recommended switching clinics.</p>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

  <p class="timestamp">21:59 BST</p>

  <p>The pub crowd turns toward the Sky TV. Remote's missing, so it stays muted. The caption scroll reads:</p>
  <p><strong>BREAKING — UNVERIFIED FOOTAGE LEAKED FROM TALLINN HOSPITAL — UK GOVT REFUSES COMMENT</strong></p>

  <p>A figure shuffles under harsh fluorescents. The camera is handheld, shaky. Their bones cast shadows <em>inside</em> their body — angular, branching. The image judders. Pixelation surges. Text at the bottom is blurred, but a phrase slips through:</p>

  <div class="quote">“TRIGRAM. BONE. MIRROR. INITIATE.”</div>

  <p>Jay snorts. “It’s deepfake theatre.” But no one responds. Because something in that moment... <em>hums</em>. The air vibrates. Or maybe it’s their own bones. Just for a second.</p>

  <p>Naila touches her wrist. Her pulse is... syncopated. Like a language she forgot she spoke.</p>

  <div class="break">* * *</div>

  <p><em>Later, she'll try to recall the exact moment it started. The shift. The scent. The thing in her marrow that was suddenly… <strong>awake</strong>.</em></p>

I’m writing this before it fades again.

The hum is stronger now. It's like when you hold your breath too long and your body starts blinking inside you. That’s what my hands feel like. The bones underneath are buzzing — not vibrating — buzzing. Like they’re waiting.

I remembered something that isn’t mine: a hallway with numbers that counted up and backward at the same time. I was inside someone else. But I was watching.

Dean said it’s anxiety. Jay said it's 5G.

But I think something’s being written inside me.
