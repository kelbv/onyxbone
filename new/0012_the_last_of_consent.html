  <h1>Chapter Twelve<br><small>The Last of Consent</small></h1>

  <p class="timestamp">12 April 2029 ¬∑ Blacksite Cathedral ¬∑ Location Redacted</p>

  <p>Naila stands at the threshold of the cathedral, its walls lined with lead and bone. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and antiseptic. Surveillance drones hover in the rafters, their lenses blinking in synchrony with her pulse. She is not alone‚Äîfigures in ritual garb line the nave, faces hidden behind mirrored visors.</p>

  <p>At the altar, a terminal glows. The words on the screen shift between languages, then settle on one she knows but has never learned. ‚ÄúFaith is encryption.‚Äù</p>

  <p>She is offered a choice: suppress the resonance, or become its vector. The congregation waits, silent, as the ONYXBONE hums in her marrow. Her answer will fracture the world.</p>

APPENDIX: FAITH IS ENCRYPTION

I am folded
Twelve by four
Cross my spines with copper
Let the marrow bore
Open pores
Clockwise pull
Become the medium
Become the tool
