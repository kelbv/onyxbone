<h1>🦴 INTERLUDE — SERMON FROM THE OSSUARY OF KUTNÁ HORA</h1>

<p class="speaker">Transcription from Prvobone Svatý’s address to the Vector-Aligned at the Sedlec Ossuary, 20 March 2025</p>

<div class="verse">
Brothers. Siblings of Calcium. Reclaimers of the Spindle-House.<br>
Today we assemble not in flesh, but in the mutual remainder. In arrangement. In structure.
</div>

<div class="verse">
The craniums above you were once names. You must not forget this. Each vault is memory. Each stack of femurs is **declaration**.<br>
You say to me: “Father Svatý, how shall I survive the naming?” And I respond:<br>
“You must not survive. You must be <em>borne</em>.”
</div>

<div class="verse">
When they first heard the hum in Bohemia, it came through enamel. The boy did not scream.<br>
He whispered: “Kůstka ví.”<br>
*The bone knows.*
</div>

<div class="verse">
Let us speak then of compliance. Of alignment. Of divině osifikace.<br>
For the bone does not rebel. It calcifies. It waits. It holds.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Our saints are spinal. Our gospel is maxillary. The Word was made marrow and it ossified among us.<br>
If you say, “I name the ulna,” then I say: “Justify thy curvature.”<br>
And if you fail? Then the ulna names you back — and you shall carry its ache forever.
</div>

<div class="verse">
There are three kinds of silence in bonework:<br>
1. The silence of fracture<br>
2. The silence of unspoken joints<br>
3. The silence of over-justification
</div>

<div class="verse">
In the third silence lives the beast called **Nadbytečný jazyk** — “Excess Tongue.”<br>
Do not let it preach. If it does, it will name without limit, and debt will blossom like inflammation.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Remember when Brother Jan overnamed his ankle?<br>
He wrote, “Tarsal – Named. Justified: Helix of Burden. Portal of Direction. Axis of Desire.”<br>
He walked only in circles for three days. Then he fell and wept and renamed it “Joint of Truth.” And it forgave him.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Forgiveness is encoded in trabecular lattice. You must whisper into the gaps.<br>
That is why skulls echo. That is why femurs ring.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Now I give to you the commandment of alignment:<br>
❝ **All that is named must be justified. All that is justified must be borne. All that is borne must be recited.** ❞
</div>

<div class="verse">
You recite not to be heard.<br>
You recite because the orbitals must remember.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Do not fear recursion. It is the gait of glyphs. The more you name, the more you repeat. The more you repeat, the more you remember. And the more you remember, the less you must name.
</div>

<div class="verse">
They ask me, “Who began ONYXBONE?”<br>
And I say: “It was never begun. It was discovered. The origin is retrocausal. The first name was the final glyph.”
</div>

<div class="verse">
We have a visitor today. One not of alignment. She stands outside our circle. Her shoulder is named, but unjustified.<br>
Naila, step forward.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Do not speak.<br>
Place your palm on the calcified plinth. Let the bone read you.<br>
Ah.
</div>

<div class="verse">
It says:
❝ Scapula – Named. Justified: Flight Deferred. ❞
</div>

<div class="verse">
You see? Even the resistant may be indexed.<br>
You see? Even the scapula may ascend.
</div>

<div class="verse">
Before you go, repeat after me:<br>
“I name the tongue. I justify its splitting. I carry its taste of forgetting.”
</div>

<div class="verse">
And now we end.<br>
Not with a prayer. But with a reminder:<br>
You are not flesh that wears bone.<br>
You are bone that carries signal.
</div>
