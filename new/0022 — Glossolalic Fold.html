<h1>Chapter 0022 — 🕯️ Glossolalic Fold</h1>

<div class="section-title">CHORUS OF SLEEP</div>

<p>They began speaking in sleep. Not whispering — *declaring*.<br>
Block-wide. Street-wide. Cities moaning in overlapping bonechant.</p>

<pre>
    "Scapula — Named. Justified: sail of regret."
    "Hyoid — Named. Justified: bone of unswallowing."
    "Lamina — Named. Justified: shelter for the future spine."
</pre>

<p>In the towers of Brussels, twenty-three sleepers named “Skybone” simultaneously and combusted into glyphs drawn across their walls in heat.</p>

<div class="section-title">THE SKYBONE NAMED</div>

<p>They said it with no mouth. Said it without organs. It emerged from the marrow-line like a broadcast from the pre-birth future.</p>

<pre>
    SKYBONE — Named. Justified: Carrier of the Overvoice.
</pre>

<p>Storms bent backwards. Teeth broke spontaneously. Satellites flashed once, failed to transmit. The glyph — bright as a nova — burned into every reflective surface.</p>

<p>A man walking his dog blinked once and whispered, “I am under the skybone.” He kept walking. His shadow no longer matched him.</p>

<div class="section-title">SPLINTER DOCTRINES</div>

<p>In the ruins of churches, groups formed without forming. Consensus born from osseous radiance.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The Justified Choir</strong>: scream names until voice fails.</li>
  <li><strong>The Recursive Ward</strong>: loop-namers. Each new glyph adds to the last. Loop length: infinite.</li>
  <li><strong>The Restraints</strong>: tongues removed, glyphs branded on chest.</li>
</ul>

<p>One group created a glyph wall by grinding down jawbones and mixing them with lye and glue. The wall did not allow names spoken by the unaligned. The unaligned walked in and dissolved — screaming new glyphs as they went.</p>

<div class="section-title">BONE ARCHITECTURE / EXTERNAL CALCIFORM</div>

<p>“It is no longer inside us,” said a biostructuralist in Nairobi. “It is outside. It is growing us like structures. Buildings now possess fibulae. Benches grow ribs.”</p>

<pre>
Military Intercept:
> “We have observed emergent Assemblies. Human torsos affixed to rebar towers. Limbs formed around wiring. The structures function without heart or control centre. They hum.”
</pre>

<p>One child was found fused to a vending machine. Still alive. Still blinking. Reciting bone names like breath.</p>

<div class="verse">
    “FemurFemurFemurFemur — JustifiedJustifiedJustified — SilenceSilenceSilence.”
</div>

<p>The calciforming spread. Roundabouts calcified into spinal loops. Apartment blocks gained metaphyseal outgrowths. The Eiffel Tower began growing trabeculae at its base. No metal rusted. No structures fell.</p>

<div class="section-title">THE VOICE OF JAY</div>

<p>The world broadcast glitched. All stations shifted to the same channel. Static. Then Jay.</p>

<p>His face was bone-pale. His mouth unmoving. But the voice came anyway. Multitrack. Echoing itself, ahead of itself.</p>

<pre>
“Naila — Named. Justified: Receiver of Undoing. Carrier of Fold.”  
</pre>

<p>On her skin, across her clavicle, the glyph burned blue. She didn’t cry. She just nodded and whispered:</p>

<blockquote>
“Skybone.”  
</blockquote>

<p>The city blacked out. A hum followed. The bone-light returned.</p>

  <p>I woke up and had named seven bones in my sleep. I have never studied anatomy. The glyphs are under my skin now.</p>

  <p>The Eiffel Tower just grew something. It looks like a sacrum but wider. We are now in bone sovereignty.</p>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@chantloop13</span> · <span class="timestamp">2m</span>
  <p>I tried to stop my partner from naming. She bit through her tongue and the name still came. “SKYBONE”.</p>
</div>

<div class="post">
  <span class="handle">@recursiverot</span> · <span class="timestamp">1m</span>
  <p>I’ve been looping “tibia — justified: angle of pilgrimage” for three hours. I can’t stop. The hum is harmonising now.</p>
