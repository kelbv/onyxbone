prime ministers office: highest level security clearance, frank conversation - even fuller knowledge of issue, collaboration with world leaders - even  adversarial ones - showing concern and ignorance on origin.. first AI research into possible target construction. contingency measures. anger. fear. how do we hijack this for our own military strength. can we use this - get on the vector bandwagon and reverse the stakes and how do we pass unnoticed and bypass ethics

TOP SECRET – TRANSCRIPT – PMO SITREP #07 – RED ROOM BRIEFING
LOCATION: Prime Minister's Office, COBR Annex, London
CLEARANCE: OMEGA BLACK
ATTENDEES: PM, Deputy PM, Chief Scientific Adviser, Defence Secretary, Foreign Secretary, C, GCHQ Director, AI Unit Lead, Defence Intelligence Lead, International Liaison (Canada, Japan, Germany, US via secure feed)
TIMESTAMP: 01:32 BST

PM:
Let’s begin. We’re at a point where plausible deniability is no longer useful. The footage is real. The events are real. And the nature of the vector… we still do not know.

GCHQ DIRECTOR:
Origin remains ambiguous. Estonian and Finnish relays confirm non-terrestrial biomechanics—we’re detecting layered camouflage in the footage, not CGI artefacts. No known nation-state can construct at this fidelity under current physics models.

DEFENCE INTELLIGENCE LEAD:
No hypersonic burn, no propulsion trail. Either this thing defies aerodynamics, or it rides them in ways we can't model. Possibly AI-designed.

AI UNIT LEAD:
Yes, and we’ve begun feeding adversarial GAN structures into a constrained sandbox. We’re trying to recreate the vector anatomy from the footage alone. Preliminary outputs suggest recursive architecture. Adaptive. Not designed for a single purpose—but to evolve purpose.

FOREIGN SECRETARY:
We’re receiving parallel concern from Paris, Berlin, and Washington. Even Beijing and Ankara are rattled. This isn't another Sputnik moment. It's worse: it’s unowned.

PM:
So it isn’t Russian? Or Chinese? Or American?

DEFENCE SECRETARY:
They're asking us the same thing, Prime Minister. There’s a degree of honesty in the panic—everyone’s just as blind. No chatter of pre-knowledge. If any nation knew and weaponised this, we’d be dust already.

CHIEF SCIENTIFIC ADVISER:
There’s a biological component. The parasitic interface we’re seeing—possibly neural, possibly osseous—suggests symbiosis or control. We’ve never seen this level of biomechanical integration. Not even in DARPA’s darkest research.

PM:
...Could we fake that we’ve understood it already? Claim we have a program? Force a bluff?

C (MI6):
We can simulate possession of fragments—seed disinformation about partial recoveries. Leak it to less credible alt-channels, wait for foreign pick-up, and then subtly legitimize. That buys us time and elevates our perceived capability.

FOREIGN SECRETARY:
Dangerous game. If Washington thinks we’re closer than them, they’ll force cooperation. Or worse—intervention.

DEFENCE SECRETARY:
We must develop an offensive profile. If the Vectors are hostile—or become hostile—we’re naked. No kinetic countermeasure exists. We need infiltration protocols, synthetic mimicry. Vector-plasmid replications.

AI UNIT LEAD:
We’re looking into reversible training. If we can decode how the biomechanical AI writes itself—through bone matrices or nerve gel—we might hijack that pattern. Mirror it back. Trojan-horse them in their own substrate.

PM:
Do it. Quietly. I don’t care what ethical boards you bypass.

CHIEF SCIENTIFIC ADVISER:
Then you’ll need to sanction black-tier clearance for CRISPR-X and zero-consent wetware trials. Geneva rules don’t apply in this context, but optics will kill us if exposed.

PM:
So don’t get exposed.

DEPUTY PM:
We should also dominate the narrative. If this becomes public—if the Estonian leak becomes global—we spin this as an existential collaboration moment. Unity of mankind. All the while, we’re reverse-engineering faster than the Americans.

C:
They’re likely doing the same. The Pentagon just requested full access to Pine Gap archives going back to 2004. That means they suspect a pre-event continuity. Maybe this isn’t the first time.

PM (sharply):
You tell me now—is this the first time?

GCHQ DIRECTOR:
No. But it’s the first time it’s failed to stay hidden.

(Long silence)

PM:
Then we play both games.
Global solidarity to the cameras.
Cutthroat reappropriation behind the veil.
Initiate VECTOR SKELETON protocol.
Get me neural simulation options. And test whether these things can be bred.

AI UNIT LEAD:
They’ll change us, Prime Minister. If we integrate this…

PM (grim):
…We’re already changing. Get me a draft for Operation ONYXBONE.
