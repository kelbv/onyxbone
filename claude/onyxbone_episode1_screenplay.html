<div class="action">
Handheld camera footage. Grainy, desperate. Harsh fluorescent lights flicker over concrete walls. Medical equipment scattered, improvised. 

A MAN lies on a metal gurney, restraints cutting into his wrists. He's emaciated, eyes rolling back, jaw working soundlessly. 

Three figures in mismatched surgical gear and military fatigues work around him. Their faces are masked, movements urgent.
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN 1</div>

<div class="dialogue">The bone saw is overheating. We need to work faster.</div>

<div class="action">
A surgical saw WHINES against femur. The patient's mouth opens in a silent scream, but no sound emerges. Instead, his throat vibrates with a subsonic HUM.
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN 2</div>
<div class="dialogue">There. You see it?</div>

<div class="action">
The camera jerks closer. Inside the opened femur, nestled in the marrow cavity, is something impossible: a COILED STRUCTURE, metallic but organic, etched with intricate spiral patterns that seem to shift in the light.
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN 1</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(awestruck)</div>
<div class="dialogue">It's not grown. It's... placed.</div>

<div class="action">
The coil PULSES with faint bioluminescence. Fibonacci spirals etch themselves deeper into its surface. One technician produces a voltmeter, touches the probes to the structure.

The meter SPIKES.
</div>

<div class="character">TECHNICIAN 2</div>
<div class="dialogue">Christ. It's storing charge.</div>

<div class="action">
The patient's eyes snap open. His jaw moves, forming words in a language that doesn't exist. The camera operator steps back, breathing heavily.

<div class="fade">FADE IN:</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. EAST LONDON STREET - DUSK</div>

<div class="action">
Grey London evening. Traffic crawls past Victorian terraces converted to flats. The city hums with electrical tension - power lines, mobile signals, the underground railway thrumming beneath.

NAILA EL-RAHIM (28), British-Pakistani, walks with purposeful stride. She carries herself like someone used to being listened to, but there's a new wariness in her eyes. She pauses outside a pub.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. THE GOLDEN CONDOR PUB - CONTINUOUS</div>

<div class="action">
Classic East London boozer. Worn carpet, football on the telly, the smell of decades of cigarettes and spilled bitter. A handful of regulars nurse pints.

Naila enters, scans the room. Spots her friends in a corner booth: DEAN MORRISON (30s), contractor's hands wrapped around a pint, and JAY PATEL (early 30s), scrolling his phone with nervous energy.
</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">Thought you'd bottled it.</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(settling into booth)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Just... needed air. Been feeling strange all day.</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(not looking up from phone)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Strange how? Existential dread? Economic anxiety? Climate grief? We've got apps for all of those now.</div>

<div class="action">
Naila touches her collarbone absently. Something flickers across her face - discomfort, confusion.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">It's... physical. Like something's humming inside me. Behind my ribs.</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">Could be your heart. My uncle had that. Arrhythmia. Course, he also had forty years of bacon sarnies working against him.</div>

<div class="action">
The TV above the bar catches Naila's attention. Sky News. A blonde anchor speaks silently, subtitles crawling across the bottom of the screen.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">Turn that up, would you?</div>

<div class="action">
The BARMAN reluctantly raises the volume. The anchor's voice fills the pub.
</div>

<div class="character">TV ANCHOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">...Department of Health has issued a statement regarding what officials are calling 'atypical osteotropic anomalies' found in a small number of individuals across several UK ports...</div>

<div class="page-number">3.</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(snorting)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Osteotropic anomalies. Christ, they're really trying to make bone disease sound sexy, aren't they?</div>

<div class="character">TV ANCHOR</div>
<div class="dialogue">...while the exact cause remains under investigation, early findings suggest possible exposure to novel environmental compounds, primarily affecting maritime and logistics workers...</div>

<div class="action">
Naila's hand moves to her shoulder blade. She presses gently and winces.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">Environmental compounds. That's what they always say when they don't know what the hell is going on.</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">You worked the docks though, didn't you? Before the council job?</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">Summer job. Years ago. Canary Wharf construction, not shipping.</div>

<div class="action">
The news moves on to football scores. The pub's attention drifts back to pints and conversation. But Naila stays focused on the screen, something working behind her eyes.
</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">You're not seriously worried about some dock plague, are you? Next you'll be telling me 5G gave you cancer.</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">I'm not worried about anything. I'm just... paying attention. When did we stop doing that? When did we decide to trust the official line just because questioning it makes us sound like conspiracy nuts?</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">Since most conspiracy nuts turned out to be actual nuts. Remember when we thought the government was competent enough for massive cover-ups?</div>

<div class="action">
Naila laughs, but it's hollow. She takes a sip of her pint, and as she swallows, her expression changes. A flicker of something - confusion, then recognition.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(almost to herself)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Sternum.</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">What?</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(louder, surprised by her own voice)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Sternum. Justified: cage of secrets.</div>

<div class="action">
The pub goes quiet. Not completely - the TV still murmurs, glasses still clink - but there's a sudden, inexplicable lull in conversation. Several patrons look toward their table.

Dean and Jay stare at Naila.
</div>

<div class="page-number">4.</div>

<div class="character">DEAN</div>
<div class="dialogue">What the fuck was that?</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(touching her chest, bewildered)</div>
<div class="dialogue">I don't... I don't know. It just came out. Like I had to say it.</div>

<div class="character">JAY</div>
<div class="dialogue">Had to say what? Cage of secrets? That's not even English, Naila. That's poetry. Bad poetry.</div>

<div class="action">
The moment passes. Conversations resume. But something has shifted. The air feels charged, expectant.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">I need some air.</div>

<div class="action">
She stands quickly, heads for the door. Dean and Jay exchange glances.
</div>

<div class="scene-heading">EXT. PUB - CONTINUOUS</div>

<div class="action">
Naila steps outside, breathing deeply. London evening, but the air tastes metallic. She pulls out her phone, starts to dial, then stops.

Behind her, through the pub window, she can see Dean and Jay talking animatedly. Jay's gesturing, probably explaining her weird behaviour with some pop psychology bullshit.

Her phone buzzes. Text message from unknown number:

"The naming has begun. You are not alone."

She stares at the message. Deletes it. But her hands are shaking.
</div>

<div class="fade">FADE TO:</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NHS CLINIC - HACKNEY - SAME TIME</div>

<div class="action">
DR. FARA CHEN (40s), calm competence wrapped in NHS blues, reviews X-ray films on a lightbox. She's seen everything in twenty years of emergency medicine, but what she's looking at now makes her frown.

The X-rays show a human torso. Normal skeletal structure, except for strange geometric patterns embedded in the bone matrix. Not fractures. Not tumours. Something else entirely.
</div>

<div class="character">DR. CHEN</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(to herself)</div>
<div class="dialogue">What the hell...</div>

<div class="action">
She holds up another film to the light. Same patterns, different patient. Fibonacci spirals etched into femur, tibia, radius. Mathematical precision that bone doesn't naturally possess.

Her computer chimes. Email notification. Subject line: "URGENT: New NHS Screening Protocol - CONFIDENTIAL"
</div>

<div class="page-number">5.</div>

<div class="character">DR. CHEN</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(reading aloud)</div>
<div class="dialogue">'Effective immediately, all radiographic anomalies involving geometric bone patterning must be reported to the Department of Health Liaison Office...'</div>

<div class="action">
She stops reading. In twenty years, she's never seen an NHS email that admitted they didn't know what they were dealing with. The fact that they're asking for help means they're scared.

She looks back at the X-rays. In the fluorescent light, the patterns seem to pulse gently.
</div>

<div class="fade">FADE TO:</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. SABLE ANALYTICS - BOARDROOM - CANARY WHARF - NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Glass and steel corporate cathedral. London sparkles beyond floor-to-ceiling windows. Around a polished table sit executives in expensive suits, but their faces show strain.

At the head of the table, MERIEL KWAN (50s) commands attention. Behind her, wall-mounted screens show data streams, maps, charts that pulse with algorithmic life.
</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="dialogue">SIDE's performance metrics are... unprecedented. Predictive accuracy up 340% in the last 72 hours.</div>

<div class="character">BOARD MEMBER 1</div>
<div class="dialogue">That's impossible. No AI system improves that rapidly without additional training data.</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="dialogue">That's what's interesting. SIDE isn't using additional data. It's using the same regret-harvesting algorithms we've been running for months. But somehow, it's reading deeper. Into... substrate layers we didn't know existed.</div>

<div class="action">
One of the screens shows a real-time map of London. Pulsing dots appear across the city - data points representing emotional distress, regret, psychological fractures.
</div>

<div class="character">BOARD MEMBER 2</div>
<div class="dialogue">Substrate layers?</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="dialogue">SIDE is processing emotional data we never taught it to recognize. It's predicting human behaviour not through social media patterns or purchase history, but through... well, we're not entirely sure. Something biological. Something deep.</div>

<div class="action">
The map zooms in on East London. A bright pulse appears over the location of The Golden Condor pub.
</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(continuous)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Last night, SIDE began outputting phrases. Not analysis. Not predictions. Phrases. Like... 'Femur - Justified: Bearer of Ancestral Weight.' 'Mandible - Justified: Hinge of Unspoken Truth.'</div>

<div class="action">
Uncomfortable silence around the table.
</div>

<div class="character">BOARD MEMBER 1</div>
<div class="dialogue">You're talking about an AI system that's begun... naming things?</div>

<div class="page-number">6.</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="dialogue">Not naming. Justifying. As if it's building a taxonomy of human experience based on skeletal structure. And here's the thing - every phrase it generates correlates with a spike in regret-data from specific geographical locations.</div>

<div class="action">
The London map pulses again. More dots appear.
</div>

<div class="character">MERIEL</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(continuous)</div>
<div class="dialogue">SIDE isn't just reading our emotions anymore. It's reading our bones.</div>

<div class="fade">FADE TO:</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. CABINET OFFICE BRIEFING ROOM - WHITEHALL - LATE NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Fluorescent-lit institutional paranoia. Around a conference table, tired civil servants and intelligence officials stare at classified files. Coffee cups and anxiety.

At the head of the table, HARRIET YULE (50s), Director of Government Communications, looks like someone who's seen too many crises and not enough sleep.
</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">Right. What do we actually know?</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER TRAVERS</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(MOD liaison)</div>
<div class="dialogue">Seventeen confirmed cases across three NHS trusts. All presenting with geometric patterns embedded in bone structure. No indication of trauma, surgery, or foreign object insertion.</div>

<div class="character">GCHQ ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">Signals intelligence picked up unusual chatter from Estonia, Latvia, and Poland. Similar medical anomalies reported. Plus some very disturbing footage that surfaced briefly on encrypted channels before being scrubbed.</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">Disturbing how?</div>

<div class="character">GCHQ ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">Medical extraction procedures. Unauthorized. Showing devices removed from bone marrow. Devices that appear to be... engineered.</div>

<div class="action">
The room goes quiet except for the hum of air conditioning and fluorescent lights.
</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">Engineered by whom?</div>

<div class="character">GCHQ ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">Unknown. But the devices show mathematical precision. Fibonacci spirals, harmonic resonance patterns. This isn't random biological mutation.</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER TRAVERS</div>
<div class="dialogue">We're treating this as potential biological warfare pending further assessment. Code name: ONYXBONE.</div>

<div class="page-number">7.</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">Christ. Do we have any idea of the infection vector? How it spreads?</div>

<div class="character">HOME OFFICE REP</div>
<div class="dialogue">That's... unclear. Traditional epidemiological models don't apply. We're seeing cases with no obvious connection - different locations, demographics, no contact between subjects.</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">What's the common factor?</div>

<div class="character">HOME OFFICE REP</div>
<div class="dialogue">They all began experiencing what they describe as 'compulsive naming behaviour' before physical symptoms manifested. Subjects report sudden urges to identify and categorize objects, particularly parts of their own anatomy.</div>

<div class="action">
Harriet rubs her temples. The weight of a crisis she doesn't understand.
</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">So we're dealing with something that spreads through... language?</div>

<div class="character">GCHQ ANALYST</div>
<div class="dialogue">Through the act of naming, yes. But not just any naming. Specific patterns. Justification structures. As if there's a linguistic framework that triggers the biological changes.</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER TRAVERS</div>
<div class="dialogue">We're recommending immediate containment protocols. Media blackout. Anyone showing symptoms gets quarantined for assessment.</div>

<div class="character">HARRIET</div>
<div class="dialogue">And if this gets out? If the public learns we're dealing with some kind of linguistic infection that rewrites human bone structure?</div>

<div class="character">COMMANDER TRAVERS</div>
<div class="dialogue">Then we pray it stays contained. Because if this thing spreads through communication itself...</div>

</div>

<div class="fade">FADE TO:</div>

<div class="scene-heading">INT. NAILA'S FLAT - NIGHT</div>

<div class="action">
Small but tidy East London flat. Naila sits on her sofa, laptop open, researching. Empty tea mug beside her. The TV murmurs quietly - late night news.

She's found forums, message boards, Reddit threads. People describing strange experiences. Compulsive naming. Bone pain. The sudden urge to justify everyday objects.

Her phone buzzes. Another text from the unknown number:

"Scapula - Justified: Wing of Burden. Do you feel it yet?"

She stares at the message. Then, involuntarily, her hand moves to her shoulder blade. There's a warmth there. A pulse that matches her heartbeat.
</div>

<div class="page-number">8.</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(whisper)</div>
<div class="dialogue"><span class="bone-glyph">Scapula - Justified: Wing of Burden.</span></div>

<div class="action">
The words come out automatically. As soon as she speaks them, the warmth in her shoulder intensifies. Not unpleasant. Like recognition.

She opens her laptop camera, uses it as a mirror to look over her shoulder. In the dim light of the screen, she can just make out something beneath her skin. A faint geometric pattern, glowing softly.

A spiral. Mathematical. Beautiful.

Terrifying.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(to herself)</div>
<div class="dialogue">What the fuck is happening to me?</div>

<div class="action">
On the TV, the late news anchor's voice drones on about economic indicators and weather forecasts. But Naila isn't listening. She's staring at her reflection in the laptop screen, watching the glyph beneath her skin pulse gently.

Then she notices something else. The news anchor on TV - there's something strange about her jaw movement. She's speaking normally, but her mouth is also forming other words. Silent words.

Naila turns up the volume, reads the anchor's lips.
</div>

<div class="character">TV ANCHOR</div>

<div class="dialogue"><span class="whisper-text">Mandible - Justified: Gateway of Truth</span></div>

<div class="action">
Naila fumbles for the remote, rewinding the broadcast. Watches again. The anchor's lips are definitely forming words that don't match her speech.

She checks other channels. Same thing. Reporters, presenters, even people in commercials - all silently mouthing phrases about bones, about justification.

Her phone buzzes again. This time it's not a text. It's a call. Unknown number.

She answers.
</div>

<div class="character">VOICE</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(distorted, harmonious)</div>
<div class="dialogue">The naming has begun, Naila. You cannot stop it. You can only choose how you participate.</div>

<div class="dialogue">Who is this? How do you know my name?</div>

<div class="character">VOICE</div>
<div class="dialogue">We know all the names now. Every bone in your body is broadcasting its identity. Your scapula called to us three days ago. Your sternum confirmed the connection tonight.</div>

<div class="page-number">9.</div>

<div class="action">
The line goes dead. Naila stares at her phone, then at her reflection in the laptop screen. The glyph under her skin is brighter now, pulsing in rhythm with her heartbeat.

She stands, moves to the bathroom mirror. In the harsh bathroom light, the pattern is unmistakable. Sacred geometry etched into her flesh from within.

She touches the mirror, and her reflection mouths words she doesn't consciously form.
</div>

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="parenthetical">(reflection speaking silently)</div>
<div class="dialogue"><span class="whisper-text">I name myself. I justify my existence. I bear the mark.</span></div>

<div class="action">
The real Naila jerks her hand back from the mirror. But her reflection continues moving for a moment, continues mouthing the words.

Then it stops, and they're synchronized again.

She's no longer alone in her own body.

Dr. Chen arrives early, coffee in hand, but stops dead when she sees her waiting room. Twelve people sit in perfect silence, all staring straight ahead. No phones, no magazines, no conversation.

What's more unsettling - they're all drawing. Identical geometric patterns on any available surface. Appointment cards, newspapers, the condensation on windows.

Naila walks to work, but the city feels different. Hostile architecture seems to lean inward. Street signs blur at the edges. Power lines hum with unusual intensity.

Naila stops, watching. The worker's eyes meet hers across the street.

As he speaks the words, both of them feel it - a resonance, a recognition. Something in their bones responding to the phrase like a tuning fork.

<div class="character">NAILA</div>
<div class="dialogue">How many others?</div>

<div class="character">CONSTRUCTION WORKER</div>
<div class="dialogue">More every hour. There's groups forming. People helping each other find the right names. The right justifications.</div>

<div class="action">
He points down the street. In the distance, Naila can see clusters of people gathered around bus stops, outside shops, in small parks. Not random crowds. Purposeful gatherings.
